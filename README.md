I'm revising The Positioning Manual for Technical Firms. It's a big, messy revision.

While I'm revising the book, I'm working in public and making the draft fully available for free right here. The permalink for the book, if you wish to share it with anyone (please do!) is: [http://thepositioningmanual.com/v3](http://thepositioningmanual.com/v3) and [https://github.com/philipmorg/The-Positioning-Manual](https://github.com/philipmorg/The-Positioning-Manual).

After I finish revising the book, I'll continue to make it available for free in an inconvenient, somewhat un-beautiful form while charging money for more convenient or beautiful forms of the book.

So for now, you can read the entire book right here in HTML: [http://thepositioningmanual.com/v3](http://thepositioningmanual.com/v3) or you can download Epub, MOBI, or PDF versions of the book at that link.

As the writing process continues, I'll update the book. If you want to get pinged when the book gets updated, [join my email list](https://philipmorganconsulting.com/list).
