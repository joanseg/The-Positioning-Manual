<p class="noindent">Specialization helps your business create more value, and creating more value makes it easier to charge premium rates and attract good clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This ability to create more value is the core reason to specialize.</p>
<p>Specialization adds value in two specific ways.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, it <em>addresses marketing inefficiencies</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And second, specialization can <em>help you cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Much more on both of these in a moment.</p>
<p>If I’m going to talk about how specialization addresses marketing inefficiencies, then I need to start with this question: <strong>what actually </strong><em><strong>is</strong></em><strong> marketing</strong>?</p>
<p>There are lots of definitions, and a few really useful definitions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are clever ones too, like Peter Drucker saying, “The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is a warm and fuzzy sentiment for marketers, but it doesn’t really say anything about what marketing is and does.</p>
<p>On the more useful end of the spectrum, let’s start with Seth Godin’s definition: (I’m paraphrasing here): <strong>marketing is changing the culture</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I know it’s incredibly broad, but it’s an important fundamental truth about marketing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But, as you know by now, as specialized businesses our target market is never “the world” or “every user of ________” or “the culture at large”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We can’t cultivate a reputation (aka market position) among groups of people that large.</p>
<p>OK fine, let’s scope Seth’s definition down a bit to the level of <em>your</em> business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When we do that, we get a definition more like this: <strong>Marketing is changing how prospective clients understand your business</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this view, marketing is merely taking charge of how your prospective clients understand your business and what you can do for them.</p>
<p>Here’s another useful definition, and it’s mine: <strong>Marketing is connecting and building trust with prospective clients</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This looks at marketing as a set of two kinds of activities: ones that create a connection between you and prospective clients, and ones that build trust with those prospects, which is actually <em>earning</em> their trust.</p>
<p>No matter which of these definitions you use, the default state of marketing is to <em>fail to work</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To be <em>ineffective</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I call these failures to work <em>marketing inefficiencies</em>.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s totally fair to ask, “What does it look like when marketing <em>does</em> work?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Does it mean you will have a flood of highly qualified clients knocking down your door?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Does it mean you will guaranteed revenue growth?</p>
<p>No, it does not mean any of those things.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When marketing works, it looks like one or more of the following outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You earn and maintain attention over time
</li>
<li>You earn word of mouth
</li>
<li>You earn and maintain trust over time
</li>
<li>You offer new ways of thinking that some choose to adopt
</li>
<li>You offer next steps that some choose to pursue
</li>
<li>You offer an exchange of value that some choose to buy into
</li></ul>
<p>Notice that these are all changes either in someone’s <em>relationship with you</em> or changes in their behavior based on <em>choices you have offered and they have freely chosen</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These changes might lead to improvements in revenue for you or improvements in the quality of clients you get to work with, but revenue or other desirable business outcomes are <em>second-order effects of marketing</em>, not first-order effects.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What creates better clients and more revenue is a better <em>system for finding better clients and generating more revenue</em>, and marketing is just one part of that system.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s an important part, for sure, but marketing is not solely responsible for your business results.</p>
<p>I hope that if you’ve thought of marketing as manipulative, sleazy, or somehow magical, I’ve managed to help you see it differently.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you think of marketing as modestly scalable activities for connecting and building trust with prospective clients, you won’t act in a manipulative or sleazy way, and you won’t attribute to marketing magical powers that it doesn’t actually have.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to that idea of marketing inefficiencies.</p>
</div><div id="cid22" data-tralics-id="cid22" class="section" data-number="5.1"><h2><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#cid22" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1 </span>About marketing inefficiencies</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">If you neglect the following “defaults” of human behavior, you will find that your marketing often doesn’t work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The default response of a human being to seeing your website or other artifacts of your marketing is to <strong>misunderstand or ignore it</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>The default response of a human being to hearing what you do for a living is to <strong>quickly forget it</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (How quickly have you forgotten just the <em>name</em> of a person you’ve just met?)<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>The default response of a prospective client to hearing about what you can do for them is to <strong>not trust you</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>These defaults are what causes most marketing to fail.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Al Ries, in his book on positioning, describes the problem of information overload from the perspective of someone living in the early 1980’s, <em>before we invited the Internet and ubiquitous wireless computing into every corner of our lives</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Whatever level of information overload Ries was describing circa early 1980’s has been amplified many time since then.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And it’s primarily this information overload combined with our ancient human hard-wiring that causes the default human behavior that causes most marketing to fail.</p>
<p>Each of these human behavioral defaults has an inverse quality that can be helpful.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you recognize and work with these inverse qualities of these defaults, your attempts to connect and build trust with prospective clients can <em>not fail</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They can be <em>effective</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The default response of a human who is a member of a social group is to <strong>treat other members of their social group better than outsiders</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>The default response of a human who has a problem that they are aware of is to be on <strong>high alert for a solution to that problem</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The more important and urgent the problem, the greater the solution-awareness.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>The default response of a human who encounters another human with high perceived status is to <strong>treat that high-status human better than lower-status humans</strong>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>Specialization helps you use these <em>helpful</em> defaults in human behavior to connect and build trust with clients more effectively.</p>
<p>There are 9 specific ways that specialization addresses marketing inefficiencies.</p>

<p class="noindent">When you specialize, you become an insider to an industry vertical, an audience, or a functional area of the business world (the supply chain, to pick just one example from many).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You won’t become a highly connected, highly trusted insider quickly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That takes time and work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But you will become an insider rather than an outsider, and in so doing you’ve become a member of a new <em>social group</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Because humans tend to treat members of <em>their social group</em> better than outsiders, you will gain an advantage.</p>

<p class="noindent">Especially if you specialize in some sort of evergreen business problem or functional area of the business world, you can benefit from the solution-seeking behavior we humans default to.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the 1984 film <em>The Terminator</em>, and I like to imagine prospects who are feeling lots of urgency in their focused search for a solution as Terminator T-800’s, with their heads-up displays seeking and scanning for their target which–in a happy departure from the film’s plot–might be you and your ability to provide a solution to the problem that’s driving their mission.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most people are not “Terminators”, and so they’ll ignore you or dedicate only a little bit of attention to what you’re doing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a generalist, you’re probably used to that anyway.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> :) After you specialize, even more will ignore you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s also OK, because the Terminators definitely will <em>not</em> ignore you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Their internal heads-up-display will light up like a Christmas tree when they find you, and that’s exactly what you want.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid73" data-tralics-id="uid73" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.3"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid73" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.3 </span>Cultural status</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Western cultures confer elevated social status on experts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Experts are almost always specialized, and even polymaths tend to be serial specialists.</p>
<p>Much of how we humans make determinations about the status of others is based on a rapid, often subconscious process of feeding signals into mental heuristics to arrive at a determination of status.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To choose just one example, the signal might be: being seen driving a luxury car, and the heuristic is one that associates driving luxury cars with high status.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In another example, the signal might be: wearing a well-tailored suit, and the heuristic is one that associates wearing well-tailored suits with high status.</p>
<p>These status heuristics get us close enough to the truth often enough, and they save our cognitively-stingy brains lots of energy and do so with little risk of harm, so we use these imperfect heuristics almost every time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We develop these heuristics individually through observation, and we receive them already-formed through a sort of collective cultural inheritance.</p>
<p>Part of this cultural inheritance is a heuristic that confers relatively high status on specialist experts.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even if we didn’t receive this heuristic from the culture, we would arrive at it through observation that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specialists often go through specialized, advanced, or simply grueling training.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Specialists can often fix certain problems faster, better, or more easily than generalists can because of their depth of specialized experience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Specialists are able to ask for and receive more financial compensation for their labor or expertise than those without any specialized expertise.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Generalists seem to outnumber specialists, so there must be something unique or different about specialists, and those with the courage to be different must have a good reason for doing so.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Specialists tend to value <em>their own</em> specialization or expertise, and this self-valuing passes for confidence much of the time, and confidence/self-valuing sends signals that we associate with relatively high status.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>Is it <em>true</em> that specialists are more important, and therefore worthy of higher social status, than non-specialists?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It doesn’t matter, because there are enough heuristics out there running on autopilot in enough people that we–at least in Western cultures–act as if specialists are of higher status.</p>

<div id="uid79" data-tralics-id="uid79" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.4"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid79" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.4 </span>Memorable, shareable, discoverable</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Specialization often makes your message about what you do or the value of what you do more memorable, shareable, and discoverable.</p>
<p>Most humans, when they see something, are going to wonder <em>what it’s good for</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s the question we ask in order to contextualize value: “What is this person or thing <em>good for</em>?”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A variation of this question is:”Where does it fit into my world as I currently experience it?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If we can’t answer that question, we’ll do our best to ignore or forget or <em>maybe</em> file for future reference a memory of this thing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But we almost certainly won’t take action with or towards this thing we can’t contextualize because we can’t value it.</p>
<p>Specialization helps others contextualize your services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specialization helps them understand <em>what your services are good for</em>, and that contextualized understanding makes your services more memorable.</p>
<p>Your message becomes more shareable because it’s specific.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That specificity makes it able to–as my friend and pricing expert Jonathan Stark likes to say–create a “Rolodex moment”, which is moment when you react to a specific message by wondering who you know who could benefit from it.</p>
<p>I suppose the following won’t be true of every human.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There is, after all, a small percentage of sociopaths among us.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But most humans, when they can contextualize and understand the value of something they’ve just discovered, will want to share the discovery.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They might do so for essentially selfish reasons.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> “If I help my friend by sharing this with them, their perception of my status will increase, and that will be good for me.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or you might do so for more altruistic reasons.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> “Life has been good to me, and other people have been good to me, and so I’d like to pay that forward any way I can.”</p>
<p>Either way, your response to this impulse to share will be to… share, but because you are sharing something that has a specific use embedded in it and will therefore only create value in a specific context, then you won’t share your new discovery with just anybody.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll search your “mental Rolodex” for a really good match and share your new discovery with those right matches.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s much easier to find these right matches when the thing you want to share is specialized such that it’s for a specific type of person or a specific situation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This makes the mental Rolodex matchmaking much easier.</p>
<p>The dynamics I’ve described above also work to make specialized services more discoverable.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The “mental Rolodex” gets accessed around the moment of discovery, when someone stumbles across your specialized business and wonders who might benefit from their discovery.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But that’s not the only time it gets accessed.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It also gets accessed when that person is asked, “hey, do you know anybody who ____________?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If I’m asked that question, it’s easier for me to make a <em>confident</em> recommendation if the match between what someone is looking for and the file card in my mental Rolodex is an exact match.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There will be less hesitation in my voice.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ll feel like the recommendation is more valuable for you because the match between your needs and what I know of the business I am recommending is a more exact match.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So your services become more discoverable through word of mouth.</p>
<p>They also become more easily searchable on the Internet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Google and other search engines have moved beyond the days of using simple keyword matching alone to rank search results, but keyword matching still matters!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And among the millions of <strong>niche</strong>, long-tail searches that Google will handle in a typical day, keyword matching will play an outsized role in determine what search results to present and how to rank them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, if you are searching for some general topic, like “migraine headaches”, then Google has to prioritize and <em>ocean</em> of content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is the opposite of searching for a niche topic.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Keywords alone are not enough to allow Google to present useful search results, so they’re going to incorporate other ranking factors like inbound links, domain age, etc., etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are searching for a very niche topic, there will simply be less raw content for Google to prioritize.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Other ranking factors like inbound links, domain age, etc.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> still matter even with niche searches, but simple keyword matching will be relatively more able to allow Google to present useful search results.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means that your specialized business will be more easily discoverable through a search engine like Google.</p>
<p>Finally, as you specialize, you will start having more contact with prospective clients within your area of focus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So their chance of “bumping into you” online or otherwise will increase because you’ll both be part of the same social group.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This also serves to make your business more discoverable.</p>

<div id="uid80" data-tralics-id="uid80" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.5"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid80" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.5 </span>Better targeting</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Specialization makes it dramatically easier to conceive of <em>who</em> you are trying to reach, which creates a multitude of cascading positive effects.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why marketing as it’s usually practiced sucks, but lack of clarity about <em>who the thing is for</em> is chief among them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This lack of clarity leads to unrealistic claims and manipulation, vague and weak messages, and a tendency to chase numbers rather than impact.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At best, attempts to connect and build trust with… eh, pretty much everybody will be boring and ineffective.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At worst, attempts to connect and build trust with a poorly defined target market or audience will be offensively filled with pressure and desperation.</p>
<p>The first thing I see happen with people who have chosen a specialization is usually a flood of new ideas about how they can start talking to prospective clients in dramatically more specific, relevant ways.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If they’re already producing content marketing or have held back on doing so because of a lack of clarity on who they are trying to reach, it’s a flood of ideas about content they could create to reach and serve a specific type of services buyer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or if they’re not even that far along in doing disciplined lead generation, then it might be a flood of ideas about how that can–for the first time–clearly communicate the value of what they do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s often as simple as knowing who to ask for referrals.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid81" data-tralics-id="uid81" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.6"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid81" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.6 </span>Marketing message</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">As soon as you decide who your services are for, you can communicate more effectively with them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I wrote the previous sentence, went on a short break, and then when I returned and looked at it, it seemed ridiculously simple.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like, insulting-your-intelligence simple.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And yet, how many of your peers know <em>exactly who</em> to recommend your services to?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> How many of you know exactly what keeps your clients awake at night?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> How many of you have received compliments from prospective clients about the powerful message they saw on your website?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specialization isn’t complicated, it’s just something that requires courage, and so it’s less common than the other approach of trying to serve basically everybody.</p>
<p>Think of your marketing message as a short (usually extremely short) story about how your services are uniquely able to create exceptional value.</p>
<p>Stories can be surprisingly short.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Although here’s no evidence to support the apocryphal tale that Ernest Hemingway wrote the following 6-word story on a bet, it’s fun to imagine him doing it anyway: “For sale: Baby shoes.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Never worn.” Short, but it packs a punch doesn’t it?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Good stories have action and consequences, and with enough specificity about either action or consequences we can infer the rest, which is what allows Hemingway’s 6-word story to say so much more than you’d think 6 words could.</p>
<p>One of my favorite marketing messages that has a sort of story embedded in it comes from Corey Quinn.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As of the time of this writing, his consulting website headline reads: “<strong>I help with horrifying AWS bills– both reducing the dollars spent as well as understanding your spend.</strong>”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Short, but it packs a punch doesn’t it?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> :) For me, Corey’s language evokes a short film clip of someone from finance walking into the CTO’s office, closing the door–the camera cuts away here to a long shot from outside the CTO’s office–following by inaudible yelling and wild gesturing at a stack of paper.</p>
<p>You can’t bring a story to life without specifics.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Details.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Characters.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A protagonist, a problem to be solved in search of a goal, and obstacles in the protagonists way.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A <em>specific</em> protagonist, a <em>specific</em> problem, and <em>specific</em> obstacles.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Andy Wier’s book, <em>The Martian</em>, is a great example of incredible specificity in all of those story elements, and for me it made the book more enjoyable than the film.</p>
<p>Your marketing message is a short story about how a specific protagonist (your ideal client, narrowly defined) can overcome a specific obstacle (the problem you help them solve) in search of a specific goal (the business impact you help them create).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Notice who is the protagonist here: your client.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Notice who is <em>not</em> the protagonist here: you, your skills, your process, or your team.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Those are the supporting characters, not the protagonist/hero.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s exactly the mindset you should be in when you’re trying to connect and build trust with prospective clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They are the hero, you are the enabler of their heroic success.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They get the credit for the success, you get the satisfaction of knowing they couldn’t have done it without you (and hopefully a case study saying just that).</p>
<p>Remember that earlier in this chapter I said that the default human behavior is to misunderstand, forget, or not trust/believe your marketing message/story.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For this reason, your marketing message contains a story, but it also needs to include other elements to help strangers <em>believe that the story could be true for them</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I won’t get into those other elements here, but in brief they are <em>proof</em> and <em>demonstrations of expertise</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Inbound marketing, if you’re not familiar with the idea, is activities that are meant to attract prospective clients to you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A great example is guesting on a podcast, saying something that resonates with a prospective client, and they respond by seeking you out and engaging your services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Inbound marketing often takes the form of publishing useful stuff and hoping that it connects and resonates with prospective clients.</p>
<p>Specialization can make your inbound marketing activities more effective because it gives you clarity about who you are trying to connect with.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That clarity makes it possible to understand what those you are trying to reach care about.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Knowing what they care about makes it possible to earn their attention.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Earning attention is the first step towards connecting and building trust.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid83" data-tralics-id="uid83" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.8"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid83" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.8 </span>Easier outbound</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you’re not familiar with the idea, outbound marketing is reaching out to prospective clients and checking for need or interest, or simply inviting them to become aware of your services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specialization makes outbound marketing easier to execute and more effective for the same reasons it makes inbound more effective.</p>
<p>In fact, effective outbound marketing is literally impossible without a clear idea of <em>who</em> you are trying to reach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most outbound marketing is going to take the form of some kind of interruption.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At the very best, this interruption will be similar to a restaurant server briefly interrupting your conversation to refill your drink.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Yes, it’s an interruption, but yes you’re also happy for the outcome of the interruption.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, it was an interruption in service of your needs, not in service of the waiter’s needs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Furthermore, it was a contextually appropriate interruption.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The waiter can observe that your drink was in need of refilling.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why they approached the table.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The subsequent interruption was necessary so they could first check for permission from you before refilling the drink, and then for the brief moment necessary to actually refill the drink.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But again, you appreciate the outcome and see how the interruption led to a desirable outcome.</p>
<p>You can’t interrupt people in a contextually appropriate way that they ultimately appreciate without being very clear about who you’re trying to reach and why your interruption will benefit them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To continue the restaurant analogy, you need to approach the right table.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You need to be pretty sure your customers there might want a refill of their drink(s).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You need to make your interruption clearly relevant, polite, and efficient.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specialization makes it possible to do outbound marketing in a way that is relevant, polite, and efficient.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that there are certain professions you will <em>never</em> see doing outbound marketing because a) they don’t need to and b) using outbound marketing would send a signal that they are not busy and therefore not valuable or competent.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But even if you want your business to be perceived as not needing to do outbound marketing, in the early days of establishing your business and cultivating a reputation, outbound marketing can be useful for “priming the pump”.</p>

<div id="uid84" data-tralics-id="uid84" class="subsection" data-number="5.1.9"><h3><a href="How-Specialization-Creates-Value_fragment.html#uid84" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">5.1.9 </span>Force multiplier</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">Finally, specialization acts as a force multiplier for your efforts to connect and build trust with prospective clients because it allows you to focus the same amount of force on a smaller area to achieve more impact faster.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You could think of how the Allied forces in Word War 2 chose a beachhead for their invasion of occupied France.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They focused a lot of force on a very small area in order to push through enemy defenses.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The same amount of force applied over a larger area would have been less effective.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You could also think of how a hypodermic needle, with its extremely sharp tip, makes it easier to penetrate multiple layers of skin to deliver its contents to a vein or to deep tissue without harming the surrounding area.</p>
<p>This makes it easier for you to “be everywhere”, because everywhere really isn’t everywhere, it’s just the places the people you are trying to reach pay attention to.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s not the \<span class="inline_math">\( \sim  \)</span>500,000 podcasts on the iTunes podcast store, it’s the 10 or 20 podcasts your target market pays the most attention to.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s not the thousands of conferences that happen every year, it’s the 3 or 5 that are most important to your target market.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s not running paid advertising on every possible platform, it’s focusing that ad spend tightly where it will have the most impact.</p>
<p>When I say that specialization addresses marketing inefficiencies, it does so for one, several, or all of the 9 reasons described above.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Even having just one or two of those 9 advantages working in your favor can make your efforts to connect and build trust with prospective clients dramatically more effective.</p>
