<p class="noindent">Chapter 3 warned you about The Fear.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But, now that you’ve peered more deeply into the world of specialization and what your options might be there, it’s a good time to talk about practical ways to manage The Fear.</p>
<p>The first fear management approach is to <strong>lower the stakes</strong>.</p>
<p>Lowering the stakes might look like specializing a digital marketing funnel as a low-stakes way to experiment with various possible specializations before committing more fully.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or alternately, build a market-first (rather than solution-first) productized service as a way to test demand for a specialized service that could eventually “take over” your business and enable a generalist to specialist transition with less existential fear.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Both of these approaches fit under the superficial specialization umbrella discussed in Chapter 7.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the right situation, these can be useful approaches.</p>
<p>My main caveat here is to properly align your expectations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Lowering the stakes might be the exact right decision because a low-stakes experiment is all your risk profile and personality can handle (see Chapter 12 for more on this).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But lowering the stakes might also reduce the potential upside for you!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or you might half-ass it because there’s not much on the line, and as a result get half-assed results.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So lowering the stakes is not a panacea, and it’s not the only right approach.</p>
<p>The second fear management approach is to <strong>gather more evidence</strong></p>
<p>Specializing can feel like making a decision that has high stakes (significant potential consequences).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you make a decision like that without a lot of information, it’s naturally a bit intimidating.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You find yourself saying things like “Am I really just guessing here?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> or “How can I be sure this will work out well for me?”.</p>
<p>The 100% honest answer is that you can’t be 100% sure it will work out well for you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I can’t be sure I won’t die driving to the grocery store later today, and according to the Insurance Information Institute, that terrible possibility is far <em>less likely</em> to happen than accidentally poisoning myself with a prescription or illegal drug!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So again, we can’t be 100% sure of much in this life.</p>
<p>But what you can do is gather evidence.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can look “look before you leap”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can identify patterns that inform your specialization decision.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 goes way deeper into this, but for now just know that the best antidote to uncertainty is the right kind of data interpreted in the right kind of way.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I refer to this as evidence, and Chapter 12 suggest what kinds you’ll need, and how to gather it.</p>
<p>“I’m <strong>mad as hell</strong>, and I’m not going to take this anymore!”</p>
<p>I’ve seen some folks use the emotional energy of anger to fuel a transition from generalist to specialist.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I think this is part of what helped me make the leap in my own career.</p>
<p>Thanks to our mammalian fight-or-flight wiring, anger can temporarily override our self-preservation characteristics.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now imagine that you’re not feeling indiscriminate anger, but a more focused, “righteous” anger at how operating as a generalist has become harmful to your business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This kind of focused, righteous anger could be a very effective antidote to The Fear, and a very effective catalyst for bold decision-making as you decide what specialization opportunity to pursue.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This isn’t something you’d do on purpose, but if you happen to be feeling angry about how things are going as a generalist, that anger could fuel a (still hopefully carefully considered) move to a specialist market position.</p>
<p><strong>Courage and risk tolerance</strong> are the best antidote.</p>
<p>The two fear management approaches described above come with compromises.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This one doesn’t: Do something courageous!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Take a calculated risk!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you can do this with the question of how you focus your business, you can do it with lots of other aspects of your business, and I can’t think of a real downside to acquiring this new ability to take calculated risks.</p>
<p>I’m not recommending wild or indiscriminate risk-taking.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’m simply recommending you do your homework on how best to specialize (again, Chapter 12 has more on this), gather enough evidence to validate your decision, and then take assertive action on that decision.</p>
<p>If you’re not currently in the position to make this kind of change to your business, of course that’s OK. Your focus instead should be taking smaller risks and smaller forms of assertive action, perhaps around increasing rates or profitability.</p>

<div id="cid43" data-tralics-id="cid43" class="section" data-number="9.1"><h2><a href="Managing-the-Fear.html#cid43" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">9.1 </span>Suggestions for cultivating courage</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Specialization is not a face tattoo.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I mean to be both serious and humorous here:</p>
<p>To contextualize how serious a decision specialization is, let me sketch out a spectrum of levels of commitment to change in order from low to high:</p>
<ul>
<li>The clothes you put on first thing in the morning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> How hard is it to change these?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Buying a television using Amazon.com.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This can be relatively low cost on the front end and low switching cost if you decide to get a different one, upgrade, or get rid of it within the no-questions-asked return period.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Buying a car.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More costly–both in terms of up-front cost and switching cost–than buying a TV, but still a decision that can be changed and un-made.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But making the change does have a bit of friction because you need to go to the dealer in the first place, and to change either go back to the dealer for a trade-in or sell it yourself, both of which entail real effort.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Buying a house.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Take the car example and basically 10x the level of work and potential switching cost.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Getting legally married.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can get un-married, but not without some level of paperwork that–even in Oregon where I got divorced–is more extensive than what you signed to get married in the first place.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And that’s not counting the emotional and financial cost of a separation and all that might happen during and after the separation/divorce.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Getting a tattoo on your face.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Yes, these can be removed, but that’s painful, and the affected skin is never the same as it was before the tattoo.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It really is, in some sense, truly permanent.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the only thing on this list that <em>is</em> permanent.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>So my first suggestion for cultivating courage is to realize where specialization actually fits in this spectrum from easy-to-change to impossible-to-change.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Depending on several things (how complex your marketing infrastructure is, how big or complex your business is), I’d say specialization is somewhere between buying a TV and buying a house in terms of how difficult it is to change.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re evaluating in terms of permanence, you should put a <em>lot</em> more thought into getting a face tattoo than any of the other decisions on this list.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> :)</p>
<p>Now, I need to remind you of the difference between specialization and your market position.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Specialization is the front-end decision; your market position is the reputation you build up by specializing and following through on it for years.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So a market position is much harder to change than a specialization decision.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s easier for a services firm to change their market position than it would be for Bill Clinton to change his reputation as a womanizer, but it’s still a fair bit of work for the services firm to change how the market perceives them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But the specialization decision?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s dramatically easier to change.</p>
<p>The takeaway here is that <em>you have freedom to experiment with your specialization</em>, especially earlier in the process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I hope knowing this helps you make a more courageous decision.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s easier to be courageous when you realize you’re making a decision that can be changed or un-made.</p>

<p class="noindent">I do a lot of labor-of-love work in this area to help show how specialization actually works:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://specializationexamples.com
</li>
<li>http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com
</li>
<li>http://theselfmadeexpert.com
</li></ul>
<p>You might also find someone in your network who actually has specialized and talk to them!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s at least a 90% chance they’ll be flattered you asked!</p>
<p>Ask them the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did it work?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>What made it work or not work?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>What challenges did specialization present?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>What benefits did it create?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>What advice do you have for others wanting to specialize?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What might you do differently next time?<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
</div>
<div id="cid45" data-tralics-id="cid45" class="section" data-number="9.3"><h2><a href="Managing-the-Fear.html#cid45" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">9.3 </span>Run the numbers</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Again, nothing is 100% guaranteed, but here’s what I’ve seen regarding the financial upside of specialization.</p>
<p>I can think of multiple examples of generalists specializing and working less while generating the same amount of revenue, or working the same amount and generating more revenue.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Connie–a self-employed mother of two–cut her workload in half and maintained the same revenue (100% increase in profitability).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Val–another self-employed mom–maintained her workload and tripled her revenue (300% increase in profitability).</p>
<p>Professional services firms that squeeze every drop of benefit out of specialization and all the downstream advantages thereof (ability to value price, ability to sell advice rather than or in addition to implementation) can break into the vaunted territory of $400,000 in revenue per full time equivalent (FTE).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’m not saying this is common, and I’m certainly not promising this for you, but it is possible.</p>
<p>So run the numbers for yourself.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What would a 100% to 300% increase in profitability look like for <em>your</em> business?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Get specific about what this would mean for you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Maybe it’s one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally able to buy a house
</li>
<li>Extend your runway from 3 months to 12 months, lower your stress level
</li>
<li>Feel less pressure to bill 40 hours/week
</li>
<li>Ability to invest in your highest-ROI investment, which is yourself
</li></ul>
<p>What you’re doing here is <em>building a vision</em> for what your future could look like.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s why it’s important to be specific.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you daydream about something desirable, you’re specific.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is just “daydreaming on purpose”, and it can help you move through fear and indecision.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid46" data-tralics-id="cid46" class="section" data-number="9.4"><h2><a href="Managing-the-Fear.html#cid46" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">9.4 </span>Estimate the cost of <em>not</em> specializing</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Avoiding change seems like a way to spare yourself the cost of changing, but avoiding change also has a cost of its own.</p>
<p>This is because the world keeps on changing, and if you’re running a business with a skills-based model, you’re more exposed to the downside of change than an expertise-based business model is.</p>
<p>You don’t get to decide how long skill in Objective C can command super-premium rates.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The predictable market forces, other service providers in the market, and Apple determine that, and they do so without much regard at all for how their decisions and actions effect your hourly rate.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So Swift or Reactive Native partially replace Objective C, and while from a technical perspective Objective C still be used to build great apps, things have changed in a way that de-values Objective C skill.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The inevitable hype around Swift or Reactive Native does some of the work of devaluing Objective C skill.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Commoditization–wherein attractive Objective C rates attract competent competition from lower cost of living areas–does the rest.</p>
<p>Without barriers to entry, licensing or formal certification requirements, or a professional standards body, super-premium rates for skill along don’t last very long in the world of technology.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can pretty safely bet on a 5 to 7 year lifespan for super-premium rates.</p>
<p>When you’re young, 5 to 7 years feels like a really long time, and making $200 hour feels like being wealthy.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you’re past about age 40, 5 to 7 years feels like much less time, and $200/hr feels like a bare minimum for access to your maturity, judgement, and ability to avoid stupid decisions (largely because you realize that making $200/hr is not the same thing at all as being wealthy).</p>
<p>So, even if you don’t specialize, you’ll still need to change with the changing times in order to remain competitive as a software developer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And I bet if you really think through the cost of upgrading your skillset at least every 3 to 5 years, you’ll see that it’s a significant time and emotional cost, if not an actual financial cost.</p>
<p>Compare this cost to whatever you perceive the cost of specializing to be.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It might level the playing field, or even tilt it in favor of specializing.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am trying here to make a strong case for specializing and support you the best way a book possibly could, but I’m not trying to “twist your arm” and force you to do it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s a little bit like getting married or being in a long-term romantic relationship.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you don’t fundamentally want to do it, it won’t work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Romantic partners and the market can both smell someone who is pretending to want them, and neither of them ultimately react well to that realization.</p>
