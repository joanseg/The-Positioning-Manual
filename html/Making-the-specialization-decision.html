<p class="noindent">@PICKUPHERE</p>
<p>In earlier versions of this book, I looked at specialization through the lens of this, which I called the Value-Specificity curve: TODO link to image</p>
<p>My admonition at that time was simple: just move from where you are towards the global maximum on that curve.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Where <em>is</em> the global maximum on that curve?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I don’t know, because it’s unique to you!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Just do it!</p>
<p>It was the right idea, but expressed in a general, hand-wavey way.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I think I can do better now.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s still very much a unique-to-you decision, but there is a standardized 7-step process almost anyone can follow to help make the decision about how to specialize.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ll present this process in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid62" data-tralics-id="cid62" class="section" data-number="12.1"><h2><a href="Making-the-specialization-decision.html#cid62" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">12.1 </span>Everybody starts from a different place</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">We all approach the specialization decision from a different starting point.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Yes, we can abstract this a bit and say if you’re not currently specialized, you’re probably some sort of generalist (you’ll say yes to almost any opportunity to apply your skill).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But when you look closer, everyone is approaching the specialization decision with a different combination of skill, risk tolerance, business experience, and personality attributes.</p>
<p>If everyone was starting from the same place, I could offer perhaps just one “specialization decision-making recipe” that everyone could follow.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if I did that, some people’s head start would be overlooked, and others lack of a head start–or different form of head start–would present them with insurmountable challenges.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So in reality, the decision is very individualized.</p>
<p>When I’m working with a coaching client, I’m looking at several factors to define their starting point.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your previous client experience
</li>
<li>Your skillset
</li>
<li>Your interests
</li>
<li>Your risk tolerance
</li>
<li>Your financial strength or lack thereof
</li>
<li>Other aspects of your personality, like curiosity and assertiveness
</li>
<li>Other aspects of your life situation, like your ability to work harder or longer hours for a time, or lack thereof
</li></ul>
<p>Taken together, these 7 factors tend to define your starting point.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid63" data-tralics-id="cid63" class="section" data-number="12.2"><h2><a href="Making-the-specialization-decision.html#cid63" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">12.2 </span>Some want different things</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Just like everybody has a different starting point, everyone wants to achieve something slightly different by specializing.</p>
<p>Now if we abstract this, you get the superficial vs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> deep specialization distinction I explained in Chapter 7.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You either want to use specialization in a superficial way (to get some quick marketing wins, for example) or a deep way (to make it possible to cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise).</p>
<p>But when I actually ask my clients why they want to specialize, I get an interesting range of answers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Just make my marketing easier/better”
</li>
<li>“Just tell me how to have a pipeline so I’m not hand to mouth”
</li>
<li>“I want better clients”
</li>
<li>“I want to be a powerful expert”
</li>
<li>“I want to be wealthy”
</li>
<li>“Someone moved my cheese and I want it back”
</li></ul>
<p>Your answer to the question, “what do you want to achieve by specializing your business?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> defines your end point.</p>
<p>With a starting and end point defined, we now have what it takes to draw a line, and the line between your starting and end point defines what you’ll need to do to successfully specialize your business.</p>
<p>How you actually decide how to specialize is based on what you want, your starting point, and personal factors like risk tolerance.</p>

<p class="noindent">You’re looking to document relevant market interest, that’s all</p>
<p>Options for doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a list of competitors, make sure you can find at least a few and that there aren’t too many (&gt;20)
</li>
<li>Find conf talks that roughly map to your particular advantage
</li>
<li>Find any other evidence that money is being spent in a way that maps to your particular advantage
</li>
<li>Reach out to and speak with any competitors or non-competitive experts that you can
</li></ul>
<p>If you’re pursuing an entrepreneurial thesis, then the above forms of market viability may not be present, so your best bet will be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach out to and speak with potential clients/customers using a customer development style of interview-based market research
</li>
<li>Additionally, you might create a strategy canvas to make sure your entrepreneurial theory targets a “real” opportunity in the market and validate that how you’re differentiating makes good sense
