<p class="noindent">Once you’ve decided how you want to specialize, it takes time, discipline, courage, and follow-through to turn that decision into a strong market position.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s specifically what you’ll need to do that.</p>
</div><div id="cid67" data-tralics-id="cid67" class="section" data-number="13.1"><h2><a href="What-you-will-need-to-turn-your-specialization-decision-into-a-strong-market-position_fragment.html#cid67" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">13.1 </span>A declaration of focus</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">You need your new focus to be very clear to prospective clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So how you declare this focus to prospects depends very much on how you connect and build trust with clients.</p>
<p>Ironically, the easiest <em>and</em> most difficult starting point for declaring your new focus is your website.</p>
<p>It’s difficult because most of my clients are not experienced marketing writers, and additionally they’re used to writing websites that focus on themselves rather than on their clients needs and problems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means when they sit down with a blank text editor or CMS screen, they kind of freeze up, and what they end up writing kind of sucks.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s generally the perception that because your website is so public and anyone literally anywhere in the world can see it, it’s a high stakes change.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It feels like your website is a megaphone that’s powerful enough to reach the entire world’s population.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And in a way it is.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> HOWEVER…</p>
<p>At the same time, the easiest place to start declaring your new focus is your website, because <em>in reality</em> it’s probably a low stakes change.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Most of my clients have a website, but when I ask them how many leads they can attribute to their website, they answer something like “1 a month” or more usually “1 a <em>year</em>”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So your powerful “megaphone” is in reality not reaching all that many people at all.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A sandwich sign at a busy street intersection would probably be more effective at generating leads.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> :) So even though it’s perceived as a high stakes change, updating your website to declare a new focus is more likely a low stakes change for you, so it might make sense to start declaring your new focus there.</p>
<p>There are other venues where you can declare your new focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email marketing content
</li>
<li>Social media presence(s), like your LinkedIn profile, etc.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Sales conversations with prospective clients, where you verbally declare your focus in the privacy of that conversation
</li>
<li>Off-site content marketing (done off your website, like talks, podcasting guesting, etc.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Print marketing assets
</li>
<li>Your personal and professional network
</li></ul>

<p class="noindent">Keep it simple.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Like, “cave man speak” simple.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Prospects will appreciate the lower cognitive load, and feel like you don’t have anything you’re trying to hide behind excessively complex language.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Don’t try to perfectly qualify clients on your site by having a long checklist of stuff you’re looking for.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That overly complicates things for prospects, runs the risk of alienating good prospects by making you seem strangely picky, and adds friction.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now if you’re at a place in your career where you’re drowning in good leads, of course ignore this advice and add the right kind of friction to make sure you only spend valuable phone time with good prospects.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But those earlier in their career can gain an outsized benefit from one simple thing: <em>more conversations</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A simple message on your site can help avoid the friction the reduces the number of conversations you get the opportunity to participate in, so keep things simple!</p>
<p>Be clear and avoid waffling.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If in doubt, use one of the following recipes for your site headline:</p>
<ul>
<li>{thing you do} for {market you do it for}
<ul>
<li>Ex: Custom software for manufacturing
</li>
<li>Ex: I help companies fix their horrifying AWS bill
</li>
<li>Ex: DevOps as a service
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>TODO: add some more positioning statement recipes
</li></ul>
<p>Frame your message in terms of your clients needs, desires, and how your focus benefits them</p>
<p>Wherever possible, let your previous clients do the talking for you through stories about <em>their</em> successes (with your help, of course), quotes, testimonials, case studies, and using their household-name logo on your site.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you have a choice between saying “we have deep skill in {thing}” and a previous client saying the same thing through a case study, testimonial, or quote, then use the version where your client says it.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, talk about how your process or unique IP facilitates positive results, but only if your process or IP is sufficiently unique.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If an objective outsider would lump your process in with an industry-standard process like agile, XP, or the old standby “design, develop, deploy” 3 or 4-stage “process”, then don’t emphasize your process because it’s not sufficiently differentiating.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Taking something that’s the bare minimum and talking about it like it’s something special is embarrassing, because it makes you look like a n00b.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This would be like a construction contractor bragging about having general liability insurance and saying that makes their business special.</p>
<p>At first, don’t worry too much about scrubbing your website for old blog articles, portfolio items, or case studies that are inconsistent with your new focus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Eventually you will want to do this, but it’s not a top priority at first.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At first, nothing is more important than your site’s ability to articulate a clear, simple message about what your focus is, and then providing evidence that you are a credible source of skill or expertise within this new area of focus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Focus on those two things first, then later you can spend time going deeper into your site to scrub old content and replace it with new content that’s more consistent with your new focus.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t overload pages on your site.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each page should have at most one “job”, with one exception: if you’ve decided to specialize and don’t have much of a web presence at all right now, I recommend you set up a 1-page web site to start with, and build that out over time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s an example of what I mean: https://1pageleadgen.site.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So on a 1-page website, the home page will have the job of declaring your focus, providing evidence that you’re trustworthy, and inviting prospective clients to take some kind of next step.</p>

<p class="noindent">You’ll also need some sort of platform for connecting with people.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Marketing types generally refer to this as “lead generation”.</p>
<p>A lead is someone who has taken some kind of action that indicates a general level of interest in your business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opting in to your email list
</li>
<li>Trading an email address for some sort of content marketing asset like a white paper
</li>
<li>Attending a talk you’ve given and then trading contact info with you afterwards
</li></ul>
<p>A prospect is someone who has expressed a more specific interest in working with you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> “Prospect” is short for “prospective client”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emailing you to inquire about your services
</li>
<li>Filling out a service-specific contact form on your website
</li>
<li>Contacting you after a referral from someone who knows about your work
</li></ul>
<p>So you’ll need a way to generate leads.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are lots of ways to do this.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ve vetted and profiled the best ones here: http://trustvelocity.com</p>
</div><div id="cid69" data-tralics-id="cid69" class="section" data-number="13.3"><h2><a href="What-you-will-need-to-turn-your-specialization-decision-into-a-strong-market-position_fragment.html#cid69" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">13.3 </span>A habit-based method for earning trust</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">You’ll also need at least one way of building trust with leads.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes you can earn sufficient trust <em>while</em> generating the lead, and sometimes it takes time <em>after</em> someone has become a lead to earn their trust.</p>
<p>I believe that wherever possible, the activities you carry out to generate leads and earn trust with those leads should be <em>habitual</em> for you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The two most damaging marketing failures I see with the kind of people I work with is a failure to focus sufficiently, and a failure to build a lead generation/trust-earning habit, and so as a result they go very long periods of time without doing either, and it causes a predictable feast-famine cycle.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now, these activities won’t start out being habitual.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You have to form the habit!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And it may take more than 90 days of what feels like challenging work to form certain habits.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But it’s worth it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Some lead generation activities have the effect of both generating a lead <em>and</em> at the same time earning trust with that lead.</p>
<p>These activities have one thing in common: they tend to involve your voice, and the more socially risky the situation, the faster trust can be earned:</p>

<p class="noindent">We usually think of this as “lead nurture”.</p>
<p>There’s a really interesting spectrum of options here, and some of them offer poorly aligned incentives, so I want to dig into this topic a bit.</p>
<div id="uid326" data-tralics-id="uid326" class="subsubsection" data-number="13.3.2.1"><h4><a href="#uid326" class="heading">The spectrum</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">On one end of the spectrum, we have a multi-step process involving some level of automation or personalization, often referred to as a marketing funnel.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have more simple, less automated approaches like sending a regular installment of content to your entire email list, or things that function like a radio broadcast in that anyone who “tunes in” can partake of the podcast or YouTube video or blog article you’ve just published.</p>
<p>The poles of the spectrum are not mutually exclusive.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can combine elements from both extremes on this spectrum, or create a sort of hybrid lead nurture system that would live somewhere in the middle of this spectrum.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That said, there are tradeoffs inherent in any choice you make about lead nurture, and it’s wise to understand those tradeoffs before you make decisions about how to approach lead nurture in your business.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, one more critical concept: “racking the shotgun”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As far as I can tell, this concept comes from marketer Perry Marshall.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> He tells a story about how an experienced card shark took his protege into a card room, pulled a sawed-off shotgun out of his coat, and cycled a shell into the chamber.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> He didn’t fire the round, he just “racked the shotgun”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That sound caused some of the gamblers in the room to immediately look up to see where the familiar but threatening sound was coming from.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The card shark told his protege: “Notice who looked up.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s who you need to worry about; you can hustle everyone else but watch out for <em>those</em> guys.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So that’s where this idea of “racking the shotgun” comes from.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s a signal that not everyone will respond to.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, it’s calculated such that only the right kind of people will respond to it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> People with a certain level of awareness, a certain level of urgency, a certain history, a certain vocabulary, a certain top-of-mind concern, a certain way of seeing the world, members of a certain social group, or some more narrow combination of several of these factors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here are some hopefully common examples of racking the shotgun in real life:</p>
<p>TODO: examples.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Consider including TEI as one of them.</p>
<p>So how do you decide where to land on this spectrum of lead generation approaches?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here are some things to consider as you make this decision:</p>
<p>If you did a pseudo-random sampling of 100 examples of each end of the spectrum, you’d get the sense that highly automated, highly personalized lead nurture tends to be used by a certain type of business that looks a lot like the typical “internet marketer” business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And you’d get the sense that simpler, less automated approaches tend to be used by more traditional, more “corporate” businesses.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And this pattern might lead you to have a negative or positive view of these approaches simply based on <em>who</em> tends to use the approach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Do you find internet marketer types personally sleazy?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll probably also find their methods sleazy as well.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Find corporations stodgy and boring?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Then you may dismiss the methods they use as ineffective or out of date.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you have no idea what I’m talking about with this whole “sleazy internet marketer” thing, do a Google image search for <em> internet marketer lambo</em>, look for images of a guy who fits the “bro” stereotype standing next to or sitting in a Lamborghini, and follow a few of those images back to the site they came from and you’ll see what I’m talking about.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The heuristic of “do what people I like do, avoid doing what people I dislike do” is one way to make a decision, but consider that it may not be the <em>best</em> way to make <em>this</em> decision about how you do lead nurture.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Now to be clear, I think plenty of internet marketers <em>are</em> actual human sleaze balls.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But I avoid dismissing their methods, because most of their methods are in fact neutral.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Whether the method is sleazy or not is a function of who is using it, their intentions in using it, and numerous implementation details, not the method itself.</p>
<p>Automation is not the same as intelligence, yet as the one setting up the automation, it can feel like it is.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And that feeling can undermine the effectiveness of your automation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Bill Gates said this in the most timeless fashion when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation"><p class="quote">The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span></p>
</blockquote><p>This frames the benefit or harm of automation in terms of efficiency, so let’s go with that framing and adapt the Gates quote thusly: “Automation applied to a business that is efficient at earning trust from leads will magnify the efficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Automation applied to a business that has not yet figured out how to efficiently earn trust from leads will magnify that inefficiency.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I often talk about premature automation, which is the idea that you’re jumping into the world of marketing automation before you have a well-developed capacity to earn trust from leads without automation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the premature automation situation, you are very likely to magnify the effect of your own mistaken, un-tested assumptions about your leads rather than scale and magnify your ability to earn trust from your leads faster, or earn trust from more leads.</p>
<p>Incentives: building lead nurture automation is not always easy, but it is always easier than building operational efficiency.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s part of why people who are actually good at building actual operational efficiency at scale are usually paid astronomical amounts of money.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They’re building the real foundational asset, and those who apply automation to it are successful mainly to the degree that they are building on top of a good foundation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a solo business owner you may be doing both, but remember that the operational efficiency–or in this case your ability to earn trust efficiently–is the foundation, and automation is the optimization.</p>
<p>I worry a bit about the incentives that modern marketing automation set up for technical folks for several reasons.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, modern marketing automation tools promise an “easy mode”, and rarely talk about the need to build atop a solid foundation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re running a SaaS (and lots of modern marketing automation tools use the SaaS business model), it’s easy to focus on CLTV &gt; CAC and let a free trial and a no-hassle cancellation policy substitute for a moral compass for whether someone really needs your software or not.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This leads you to build a marketing story that positions your marketing automation product as a magic bullet for lots of things that it <em>can</em> do if you’re building on a solid foundation but definitely <em>can not</em> do if you lack that foundation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s easy for the SaaS person to say “well, it’s free to try and easy to cancel, so we’ll just let customers figure out if it really works for them”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This leads to product marketing with unrealistic claims and insufficient customer screening.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But worse, over time it leads to a <em>belief in the market</em> that the right tool will substitute for the need to do the dirty, un-sexy work of building a foundation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Really think about this: How many of your beliefs about marketing (remember, this is simply connecting and building trust with prospective clients) come from direct experience, and how many are formed by the marketing and sales copy of <em>companies with a marketing product to sell and questionable standards for selling it</em>?</p>
<p>In short, part of the misaligned incentives come from how SaaS companies market their products.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The second source of misaligned incentives comes from the fact that modern marketing automation tools can be a fun distraction from the real work of getting good at earning trust and cultivating exceptionally valuable expertise.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I speak from experience here.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I lost quite a bit of time to the fun but unproductive pursuit of magical automation solutions to a problem that could never be solved with automation: my deficient ability to attract leads and earn their trust efficiently.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Technical people (and though I’m not a developer, I was a sysadmin and technical trainer for 10 years, so I definitely have a finely honed appreciation for the pursuit of shiny objects) are usually predisposed to enjoy solving certain kinds of problems merely for the satisfaction of solving the problem rather than the business benefit of solving that problem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, we get an emotional ROI on solving the problem, and that emotional ROI has nothing to do with whether the solution even <em>has</em> a business ROI.</p>
<p>For lots of technical folks, the emotional ROI of figuring out marketing automation exceeds the emotional ROI of figuring out how to efficiently earn trust from prospects, and so we dive right into maximizing our emotional ROI and skip past the essential foundational work of building an efficient trust-earning operation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is a costly mistake, and it comes from misaligned incentives.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The answer is to become aware of and honest about what’s actually happening (hopefully I’ve helped with that here), get real about whether you’re willing to do the dirty, necessary foundational work, and then apply effort and discipline to build the foundation before you move on to the more emotionally rewarding optimization work.</p>
<p>The highly automated approach also makes it easy to hew towards a solution-first approach rather than a market-first approach.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Part of the reason why is that marketing automation solutions are often positioned as very effective ways to persuade or spur leads to take action.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re coming from a solution-first approach, you’ll be tempted by everything that seems able to help you sell your solution, and the less the actual market actually wants it, the more desperate you may become.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ve sen lots of my coaching clients struggle and then finally figure out what their market wants.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When they do, it’s like pouring gasoline on a fire.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s nearly explosive, and while they might add in marketing automation to scale things, marketing automation is never the thing that turns the small fire into a huge roaring fire.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the fit between what the market urgently needs and what they’re offering.</p>
<p>My favorite example of this is Tom, who <em>sells marketing automation services!</em>, but he had the patience and discipline to refine his offer to the point of fantastic product-market-fit on Upwork of all places before he moved into applying marketing automation to his own business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Additionally, he spent months doing a grueling daily publication challenge to further deepen his expertise and get feedback from his audience before building on that foundation of insight and expertise and trust-building efficiency with marketing automation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It takes significant discipline to do this, and Tom has definitely reaped the rewards of this discipline and patience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if you haven’t found that fit between what the market urgently needs and what you offer, and you’re getting impatient, it’s very easy to start seeing premature automation as a solution because that’s exactly how lots of marketing automation tools market themselves!</p>
<p>Finally, marketing automation can play into tendencies you might have towards social awkwardness or avoidance of realtime communication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I share in some of these tendencies, so don’t worry, I’m not criticizing or making fun of you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But, as I often like to say: unfortunately, you’re in a relationship business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s “unfortunate” because many of you would prefer to be in an isolation business, or a maverick genius business, or a leave me alone so I can code business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But unfortunately, relationships play an outsized role in your success, and for many of us, that means we need to work on improving an area that we’re naturally weak in.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Marketing automation seems to provide a way out of doing this hard work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We think: “I’ll pour my best efforts at relating and connecting into an automated email sequence and <em>that</em> can do the hard, uncomfortable work for me!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And better yet, it’s far more scalable than my own time is!”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And maybe it can.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But if you want better results in your business, I urge you to improve two things: your ability to connect with leads, and your ability to earn their trust.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Half of your ability to do these two tasks better comes from relationship skills, and the other half comes from cultivating economically valuable expertise.</p>
<p>Wow.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sounds like I’m pretty anti-marketing automation, huh?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Nope!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I just know who I’m talking to here, and at least 80% of you need to do more foundational work in the following areas <em>before</em> you do much with marketing automation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing a narrow focus so you know exactly <em>who</em> you’re trying to connect with and earn trust from
</li>
<li>Gain insight into their world, so you know exactly <em>what</em> value you are creating for them
</li>
<li>Cultivate a <em>point of view</em> so that your marketing is meaningfully different from others with a similar skillset or body of experience and so that leads find something attractive or repellant in you
</li>
<li>Build a <em>body of work</em> that demonstrates real, deep expertise rather than commoditized skill
</li></ul>
<p>Let’s look now at the other side of this spectrum (more like broadcasting, less like automation &amp; personalization) and consider the lead nurture approaches we might find there, which would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly publishing to a blog, email list, or both–with content that’s not personalized at all.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Publishing a podcast
</li>
<li>Speaking at an event
</li>
<li>Publishing a video on YouTube
</li>
<li>Publishing an article in a niche publication your audience reads
</li></ul>
<p>These approaches all look like some form of broadcast.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you buy into the promise of segmentation, personalization, and automation, then the idea of broadcasting the same message to a group seems inefficient and outdated.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’d like to make a case for why it might not be.</p>
<p>If you take what I’ll simply call the “broadcast approach”, you’ll tend in one of two directions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll either play it safe and try to speak to the broadest possible audience (which means you have nobody specific in mind as the beneficiary of your content) or you’ll be bold and think more in terms of building a body of work over a significant period of time for <em>somebody in particular</em>.</p>
<p>Why only <em>one</em> of these two directions?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’m not 100% sure, but like oil and water, they just don’t seem to mix.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’re either trying to maximize broad appeal, which means you mistakenly believe you’re playing to avoid losing, or you’re playing to win, which means you actually understand how things like content marketing actually work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you’re trying to maximize broad appeal, then going very narrow and specific with your lead nurture feels threatening.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> “What if a great lead shows up and we completely miss connecting with them in our lead nurture content?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you actually understand how content marketing actually works, you see an Internet overflowing with me-too content and so you zig when others are zagging, and you go narrow because you know that will be irresistable to your <em>ideal</em> prospects, of whom there are more than enough to support your business.</p>
<p>If you broadcast and go narrow and specific with the focus of your lead nurture content, you create several other beneficial outcomes:</p>
<p>You’ll have to make a decision about how best to serve your leads.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll correctly sense that it’s inappropriate to treat them all like they’re at the same stage of the buying process, and so you’ll be largely relieved of the urge to push them to buy or take some buying action.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You’ll correctly sense that this kind of pressure would be a real turnoff to those who are earlier in the buying process.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Those leads would rightly see you as pushy.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And so you’ll lay off sales pressure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What will you do instead?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As my friend and colleague Liston Witherill so wonderfully puts it–you’ll serve, not sell.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And as long as you have a reasonably relevant offer, the sales will happen anyway, and they’ll happen in direct proportion to the impact that your attitude of service creates.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And they’ll happen not because you pushed, but because leads approached <em>you</em>, which incidentally flips the sales power dynamic very much in your favor.</p>
<p>So if you’re not sending super personalized lead nurture content to narrow, specific segments of your audience where you meet them exactly where you think they are in the sales process with content that’s fine-tuned for that stage of the buying cycle (how many of you would even know <em>how</em> to create that kind of content even if you had the hyper-targeting capability?), then what’s left for you to do with your lead nurture content?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> My answer to that has long been: go deep, be generous, and play the long game.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Another way to put this would be: build a brand for yourself as a true expert.</p>
<p>If you look at most experts, the value they have to offer, and the price for accessing that value, it looks a lot like this: {graph with “free” on one end and “very expensive” on the other and two tall, narrow bell curves, one centered over the free end, and one centered over the very expensive end, with very little in between}.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The considerable price experts can charge for the application of their expertise affords them enough time to produce a significant body of work for free or very low cost ($19 books, for example), and they’d often prefer to maximize reach for their ideas, which is why they invest so heavily in free content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, they can <em>afford to be</em> generous, and so they are.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And they know that there’s no limit to how deep that can go with their free lead nurture content because there’s always enough prospects out there who will pay a premium price for the specific application of an expert’s expertise to their specific situation or needs, so they don’t feel like they have to hold back in the free content, or use it as some kind of cheap tease for their services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Viewed through this lens, an expert who publishes fresh new insightful content to an email list of leads on a weekly or more frequent basis appears a lot more successful than one who sets up some automated lead nurture sequences and then retreats away to focus on their evidently less profitable client work.</p>

<div id="uid336" data-tralics-id="uid336" class="subsubsection" data-number="13.3.2.2"><h4><a href="#uid336" class="heading">“The Terminators” vs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> everybody else</a></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that I’ve laid out my case for why you might <em>avoid</em> marketing automation, let’s talk about why and how you might make use of it :)</p>
<p>If you were in a situation where you could only do broadcast-style publication at relatively high frequency or automated, personalized lead nurture, I’d recommend the broadcast style publication every single time because it has more beneficial side-effects than automated lead nurture.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Granted, this may only be true for those who are trying to cultivate deep, valuable expertise, but you’re the ones I care most about helping, so my advice is calibrated for you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So again, it’s possible you’re in a situation where you have to choose between broadcast or automation.</p>
<p>But it’s more likely you can combine elements of both approaches.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And in that situation, I recommend you do combine them!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But in a specific way.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Before I lay that out for you, let’s talk about “The Terminators”.</p>
<p>There are leads who–somewhat like The Terminator in James Cameron’s 1984 film by the same name–are on a very specific mission to find a solution to their problem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s like they’re walking around with an internal heads up display, scanning and seeking for something very specific.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I do believe you can create lead nurture content for these “Terminators”.</p>
<p>Remember “racking the shotgun” from earlier in this chapter?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What kind of sound would get the experienced gamblers to look up?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> What kinds of signals would match would these Terminators are looking for in their heads up display?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instead of looking for Sarah Connor, they’re looking for a solution to a specific problem.</p>
<p>TODO: research on the concerns of various stages of the buying cycle and ways of racking the shotgun that could speak to these various concerns.</p>
<p>So group your leads into two camps: The Terminators, who are seeking a solution, and everybody else, who is a potential future client but they currently lack the singleminded focus of your Terminators.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You don’t have to do this grouping with any kind of actual formal segmentation or marketing automation trickery, you just periodically rack the shotgun in a way that speaks to your Terminators.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The others will barely notice as you continue to build your expertise brand with them so that when they become a Terminator (because their problem has moved from not-urgent to urgent, for example), they think of you and your expertise.</p>
<p>So what do you do for The Terminators?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I suggest an email autoresponder sequence, sometimes referred to as an “email course”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> One that speaks to the stage in the buying cycle you want to connect with.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here’s one example of how I do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an email course I call “Coder to Consultant”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It speaks to someone who is starting to feel an urgent need around changing their business identify from coder to consultant.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>I have a page where anybody can opt in to this email course: <a href="http://coder2consultant.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://coder2consultant.com</a>
</li>
<li>I’ll periodically mention this course in the emails I send my entire list of email leads.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Those who are feeling this urgent need to shift their business identity hear me “racking the shotgun” and they can either visit the ht<a href="tp://coder2consultant.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tp://coder2consultant.com</a> page to opt in or click an in-email automation link to be added to that email sequence.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>So The Terminators can enter an email course in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can stumble across it while visiting your site.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This won’t happen if it’s not available and prominently featured on your site, so make it… available and prominently featured on your site.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> :) The top of your home page is one good place for this kind of thing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>They can stumble across you guesting on a podcast, giving a talk for someone else’s audience in a webinar or at a conference, running an ad for your course, or elsewhere online.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As part of the content you are creating for someone else’s audience, you can have what’s known as a call to action that directs interested parties to your email course page.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>They can notice you talking about your email course in your regular lead nurture content.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means they’re already on your list, but perhaps your email course hasn’t caught their attention before now because they weren’t interested or ready to take action until now, or perhaps this is just the first time they’ve noticed you talking about it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>Definitely decide how you want to earn trust after someone becomes a lead (lead nurture) based on what’s best for you and your business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I hope you see that there are some real differences between the personalized, automated approach when compared to something that looks more like broadcast publication.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I think the latter gets unfairly overlooked because it’s more work, but it has some benefits that I hope are now apparent to you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Again, you can combine approaches and I’ve seen that work very well, and I do that myself in my own business.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Overall, just make sure you’re choosing your approach based on its actual merits when applied to your business over the long term, not based simply on convenience or the short-term emotional ROI of one approach over the other.</p>
</div></div></div><div id="cid70" data-tralics-id="cid70" class="section" data-number="13.4"><h2><a href="What-you-will-need-to-turn-your-specialization-decision-into-a-strong-market-position_fragment.html#cid70" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">13.4 </span>A relevant offer, or ladder of relevant offerings</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">When it comes to your service offerings, there’s another spectrum at play.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On one end is a “hire us for whatever” kind of offer: completely custom scope, completely open-ended, and completely custom price (or more likely, a guesstimated estimate and a final price derived from hourly billing with a pretty low accuracy with respect to the original quote).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And on the other end of this spectrum is some sort of packaged service offering where the scope and price are both pre-determined, and the delivery process is fairly standardized, systematized, and perhaps optimized for profitability.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is often referred to as a productized service because like many products, its configuration and price are standardized across all customers.</p>
<p>One thing deep expertise can do is help you move from the custom to the productized end of this spectrum.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s nothing inherently superior about a productized service, but there is something about it that signals that you are an expert, and that signal is this: you know what to expect before you get into the engagement, and for this reason you can define the contours of the engagement without depending on the client to do that for you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s nothing exploratory about it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Your ability to set a fixed price signals confidence in your ability to execute the the work with great consistency and few surprises.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Brain surgeon’s don’t ask for your input on where to make the incision and what to do once they get in there for this same reason.</p>
<p>If you prematurely productize a service, the lack of this same expertise can cause low profitability because you set the price too low or it takes too much work to deliver the promised result or surprises slow things down, and it can cause other customer experience problems.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Plenty of experts deliver services on a completely custom basis, and this can work out very well.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So again, neither custom nor productized are inherently superior.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But as you cultivate expertise, I hope you’ll set the following as a minimum bar for how you define or package your services:</p>
<p>Most generalists talk about their services based on the skill or discipline that underlies that service.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is another signaling mechanism that reinforces their status as vendors of a service defined by outputs rather than one defined by its impact.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They’re saying, in essence, “Here’s a bunch of semi-related skills.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We don’t know the best use for them, so we’ll leave that decision up to you, dear client.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This would be like the brain surgeon having a website where they list their equipment and skills.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is fun to think about, so let’s try an abbreviated example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment:
<ul>
<li>Scalpel
</li>
<li>Bone saw
</li>
<li>TODO: more crazy shit like this.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Skills
<ul>
<li>Can make cuts within 1mm of the intended cut point
</li>
<li>Can stand on feet for many hours while performing surgery
</li>
<li>Can remain focused and not check email every 5 minutes
</li>
<li>TODO: more crazy shit like this
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>A completely normal Services page on a generalist firms website would be a grid or list of “services” that are actually a list of skills or disciplines.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If it’s a dev shop, you’ll see a list of languages, frameworks, and functional areas of skill.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ex: Ruby, Python, C#, React, Node.js, DevOps, Testing, AWS infrastructure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Or if it’s a digital marketing agency, you’ll see a list of the components of a campaign or digital marketing solution.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Ex: Facebook ads, copywriting, WordPress design, SEO, content marketing, CRO. This is exactly like an auto repair shop that lists all of its equipment on its website instead of a list of what that equipment can do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Auto repair shop acting like dev shop: Hydraulic lift, impact tools, 300-piece socket set, oil changing equipment, engine computer diagnostic system, tire repair components, etc, etc (you get the idea by now).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Actual auto repair shop: We can perform a smog check, repair or replace damaged tires, change your oil, tune up your engine, perform yearly maintenance, etc, etc (you get the idea by now).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s inputs compared to outcomes.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Tools/skills compared to results those tools/skills can achieve.</p>
<p>To further think this through, imagine what would happen if an auto repair shop had the exact same set of tools, but in Scenario A they know they are focused on repairing automobiles, and the Scenario B their memory has been tampered with and they forget what kind of machinery they are focused on repairing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They look at their garage full of tools and say, “Wow, we could repair anything from a chainsaw to cars to an industrial generator to a dragline excavator!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Really, anything with an internal combustion engine is fair game for our services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So let’s make sure people know that when they visit our website.”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In Scenario A, their website looks like what we’d expect an auto repair shops website to look like.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But in Scenario B, might not their website look a lot like the one where they list their tools because they have no idea what their customers will want them to use those tools for?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, might not their website look a lot like the typical professional service firms’s website where services are really just a list of skills or disciplines?</p>
<p>If your list of services is really just a fancy list of skills or disciplines, then you are sending a signal that you don’t know and haven’t decided <em>who or what those skills are for</em>, and so your website starts to look a lot like another kind of businesses website: an equipment rental company.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We fully expect an equipment rental company to have a website with a list of equipment and the day rate for each piece of equipment, because they literally have no idea what you will use that equipment for.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The same trench digger might be used to install an irrigation system in your yard <em>and</em> later, by another customer, to install a fiber optic cable between two office buildings to enable a large and highly profitable expansion of some sort.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The economic value of the latter use is much larger than the former, but the equipment company charges both customers the same day rate for the trench digger.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They’re not in the business of caring <em>what you use their tools for</em>, and if your list of services on your website is only a list of skills or disciplines, then your website is sending the exact same message: “Here are our tools.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Use them for whatever you like.”</p>
<p>While a fully productized service would define what the service is for, the scope and delivery mechanism, and the price, you don’t have to go that far to signal expertise.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The minimum is this: <em>define what or who your service is for</em>.</p>
<p>If you can do at least that, then you’ll have made a significant step forward.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Define who or what your service is for, and do so in a way that is <em>specific</em> and <em>objective</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Avoid stuff like this, which is a non-specific or totally subjective way of defining who or what your services are for:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Innovative small businesses” (How would you measure innovativeness in order to exclude poor fit prospects?)<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>“Dynamic businesses” (What does “dynamic” even mean?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Who gets to define how “dynamic” the prospective client is?)<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>“Fast-growing businesses” (How will you measure their growth?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Where will you set the cutoff?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Why are your services only good for fast-growing businesses?)<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>The basic level is to define who or what your services are for, and then, if you can, move on to explain <em>why</em> your services are optimized for this kind of business or business problem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is where it gets harder, because you actually have to construct a coherent argument for why your business focus, experience, and track record align well with the needs of a particular type of business or business problem.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If you don’t know your ideal clients well, this is both risky and difficult.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It gets easier to make this argument after you’ve been focused in a particular way for several years.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So consider this <em>why</em> component of your services page to be the advanced level.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Again, the basic level of refinement for your service offering is to declare who or what they are for.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That’s enough to start to differentiate you from the ocean of generalist competition out there with their list of “tools for rent” on their services page.</p>
<p>Finally, you may want to consider a “ladder” of service offerings.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you construct a ladder of services, you are creating options for your clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I’ve heard this referred to as a “choice of yesses” rather than a “yes or no” decision.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are several good ways, and several bad ways, to organize a ladder of services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The following are generally good ways to do so:</p>
<p>A spectrum of services along a scale of increasing involvement from diagnostic only to diagnostic + complete solution to diagnostic + complete solution + desirable add-ons.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The desirable add-ons often take the form of ongoing support, or “insurance” of some kind.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Notice there is no “without diagnostic” option available, for the same reason you can’t just waltz into a brain surgeon’s office and hop onto the OR table for a brain tumor removal without going through a very thorough diagnostic first.</p>
<p>A spectrum of services along a scale of increasing impact from a quick fix to a deeper or more permanent fix to a deeper fix + desirable add-ons.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The desirable add-ons might take the form of skill transfer, ongoing support, or “insurance”.</p>
<p>A spectrum of services across a variety of delivery models, from done-for-you to done-with-you to teach-you-how-to-do-it-yourself.</p>
<p>And I’d suggest avoiding the following ways of organizing your ladder because they signal a lack of expertise:</p>
<p>A mix of services that include a “no diagnostic” option.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This signals that you either have no unique diagnostic or strategy value to contribute, or you consider your diagnostic or strategy value interchangeable with that of others.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is like waltzing into that brain surgeon’s office, saying “I’d like you to remove this tumor that my doctor friend Pat diagnosed”, and then the surgeon says “Great, let’s do it” with absolutely no validation of their own.</p>
<p>A ladder of services with poorly-differentiated “rungs”.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Will prospects have difficulty understanding why they should choose one service over another?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> That might just be because they’re an inexperienced buyer of services like yours (that’s not always a bad thing, and with some of the more specialized horizontal service offerings you may fairly regularly encounter this), or it might be because your ladder of services is simply confusing or poorly organized.</p>
<p>You may choose to not list your entire ladder of services on your website.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Some parts of the ladder may only be exposed to your clients, and not to the general public.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Borrowing terminology from the world of direct response marketing, I often call these “back-end” services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They’re services that are easier to sell to people who have already paid you and therefore trust you and pose a lower cost of sale than non-clients, or they are services that only make sense to sell to existing or previous clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, imagine that your ladder of services includes design and implementation of a custom CRM for contractors.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When you do the design work, you use a proprietary research method to understand your client’s CRM needs, and you translate the results of this research into how the software is designed.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But, beyond just the software, the data your research collects on your client’s sales team is helpful for making other changes to the business process the company uses in their sales department.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You might offer a “back-end” service where you help your client interpret the findings of your research and make process changes in concert with adopting their new custom CRM. Offering this service on your website might not make sense because it could be hard to help prospects see its value without first doing the research, and you’re trying to reduce any extra cognitive load on the website.</p>
<p>Implicit in the idea of a ladder is that clients will climb it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is where the analogy of a services ladder breaks down, because some ladders are organized such that some clients will enter it only at the highest level and others will, over time, actually climb it as they move from a small, entry level engagement towards the bottom of the ladder to a more robust, deep engagement higher up the ladder.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The main point here is that you shouldn’t take the “ladder” analogy too strictly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s more about the “choice of yesses”—or a small menu of focused relevant entrees—than it is about a “small to big” arrangement of services.</p>

<p class="noindent">Eventually, you’ll need an ecosystem of support.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Remember that what we’re talking about here is what you need to turn your specialization decision into a strong market position.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Remember that your market position is your <em>reputation</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Remember also that I like to say: unfortunately, you’re in a relationship business.</p>
<p>One of the ways you can cultivate the reputation you want is to recruit the help of other people:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who can refer you when the right kind of prospective client asks them for a referral.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>People who can get you in front of their audience and help you connect with the right kind of prospective clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>People who can call attention to your work because it’s relevant to their audience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>People who have a complementary product or service who can refer you to their customers or clients.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>People who admire your work and spread the word without you asking them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>One of my coaching clients is cultivating a relationship with a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter whose beat (the intersection of tech, business, and culture) overlaps with my client’s focus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> My client is playing the long game of slow, gradual engagement, starting with social media interaction.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Eventually, this WSJ reporter will be part of my client’s ecosystem of support.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I don’t know exactly how or when, but I call this out here because it’s a good example of what I mean by an ecosystem of support.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can run your business alone, but you can’t reach the highest possible level of success without other people.{@TK: source} calls this a “circle of eminence”, which sounds pretentious and dumb but captures the same idea.</p>
<p>Cultivating an ecosystem of support is something you can do intentionally, but it’s not something you can develop a granular, precise plan for.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s much more about keeping an ear to the ground for beneficial relationships and opportunity, and then taking action when they present themselves.</p>
<p>Lastly but not leastly, you need something I’ve mentioned several times already: time and disciplined followthrough.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can specialize with some courage and a quick decision making process, but you can’t build a strong market position without time and lots of disciplined followthrough on your part.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The time is best measured in years, not months or weeks, and the discipline is about what it takes to complete a PhD degree in a timely fashion.</p>
