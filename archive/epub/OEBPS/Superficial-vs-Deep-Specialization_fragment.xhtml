<p class="noindent">There are two valid ways to look at specialization.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I will refer to one of them as <em>superficial</em>, and I don’t mean that as an insult.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I simply mean it doesn’t go that deep.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It therefore has different requirements and delivers different benefits to your business.</p>
<p>For a long time, I felt like these two meanings of specialization were in tension.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Maybe they are, but that need not stop me from helping you use either or both.</p>
</div>
<div id="cid33" class="section"><h2><a href="Superficial-vs-Deep-Specialization_fragment.xhtml#cid33" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">7.1 </span>Superficial Specialization</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Superficial specialization is a marketing tactic, a market research technique, or some combination of the two.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It might also be relatively temporary in duration, or done as a first transitional move out of the generalist market position.</p>
<p>Generally, superficial specialization means changing your marketing message to focus on business outcomes or the needs of a specific market vertical or specific type of buyer rather than technical inputs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This change will trickle down into how you talk to clients as well.</p>
<p>You’ll still have room to talk about technical inputs, but those get pushed down to the level of a supporting detail in your message.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> At the headline level, your message becomes one that’s focused on business problems and outcomes, contextualized within a particular vertical market or horizontal problem or audience of buyers.</p>
<p>Superficial specialization might also mean specializing a marketing funnel so it speaks more specifically to a vertical or problem domain.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You might have multiple “micro funnels” in place, each with a different flavor of specialization.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I worked with a client who used this approach to experimentally identify where he could find the strongest interest in his DevOps consulting services.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> When he got lukewarm interest in a campaign specialized in migrating away from Heroku but got \<span class="inline_math"><span class="MathJax_Preview" style="color: inherit; display: none;"></span><span class="MathJax_SVG" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" tabindex="0" style="font-size: 100%; display: inline-block;"><img src="images/texmath/79be3a87933d6c926d9c9ebf65b49c69d2244a3a.png" alt="epub/OEBPS/images/texmath/79be3a87933d6c926d9c9ebf65b49c69d2244a3a" style="height:0.49674em; vertical-align:0.14781497400000002em;" /></span></span>80% open rates on a campaign focused on Kubernetes, it became pretty clear where he could more easily gain attention for his work.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Building these two micro-funnels required work, but less work and investment than a “blind pivot” would require.</p>
<p>Superficial specialization is generally campaign-based, rather than a career development strategy.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As a reminder from a previous chapter, this specialization approach lines up with the notion that positioning is a verb; something you do actively over a short time frame in order to achieve some sort of tactical win (lead gen, dealing with a famine phase, etc.)</p>

<div id="cid34" class="section"><h2><a href="Superficial-vs-Deep-Specialization_fragment.xhtml#cid34" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">7.2 </span>Deep specialization</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">Deep specialization is a career development strategy.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It looks as your market position as a noun; an asset that you build over time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It looks as your market position as the result of coordinated, disciplined action over a longer time frame to achieve a strategic win (become attractive to vastly better clients, become seen as a category expert, move from implementation to advisory work, etc.)</p>
</div>
<div id="cid35" class="section"><h2><a href="Superficial-vs-Deep-Specialization_fragment.xhtml#cid35" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">7.3 </span>Overlap between these two concepts</a></h2>
<p class="noindent">There’s some inevitable overlap between these two ways of understanding positioning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They both involve focusing or re-focusing, but the demands of deep specialization require that we commit basically 100% to a single chosen path for specialization.</p>
<p>That said, you might use multiple superficial specialization experiments to validation a direction for deep specialization</p>
<p>The deep specialization approach is more ambitious and takes longer to execute on.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s also the one that’s more likely to result in a strong market position after all that work.</p>
<p>They start at roughly the same place, but they end up at very different places because of one thing: <em>expertise</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Superficial specialization is a way to address some marketing inefficiencies; deep specialization is a way to transform your business model from one based on outputs to one based on expertise.</p>
<p>How should you choose between the two?</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>low risk tolerance and low business maturity</strong>: probably superficial
</li>
<li>If <strong>low risk tolerance and greater business maturity</strong>: validate via superficial, then go deep
</li>
<li>If <strong>high risk profile</strong>: you’ve got lots of choices if you’re smart about them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> High risk profile doesn’t mean you are guaranteed to succeed, but it does mean you are less likely to pull back or “flinch” at a critical moment when staying the course instead of flinching is the difference between success and failure.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>TODO: Interesting idea: business maturity metric (based on years working for self, number of clients/projects/etc, and any other important factors with some kind of metric to compare against) as a way to think through superficial vs.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> deep positioning.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Back-test this against my clients</p>

<p>Your market position is a lagging indicator of the relevance and value of your specialized expertise.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s the mental residue of your marketing message and client interactions over time.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s your reputation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> {might move this to ch 04, or just have this be a reminder of this same point as elaborated in ch 04}</p>
