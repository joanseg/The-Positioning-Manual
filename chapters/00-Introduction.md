# Introduction

I wrote the first version of TPM as an excited evangelist of an idea, and I wrote the second version as a diligent researcher seeking greater insight and fidelity. Now I approach this third version as a more seasoned practitioner, hoping my considerably deeper in-the-trenches experience translates to clearer thinking, better articulation of that thinking, and more practical, nuanced, and useful recommendations.

The updates to version 3 are numerous:

- Standardized terminology
- More context around the business function of specialization
- Way more context around the nuances of specialization
- More grounded, practical recommendations based on your business maturity
- More information on the relationship between specialization, your market position, and other common understandings of positioning
- More information on the role of expertise in specialization, and recommendations on how you might aggressively cultivate valuable expertise

## How to Use This Book

Just read it straight through. Each chapter is better than the one before it. Chapter 12 is a sort of climax, but making the best use of that chapter depends 100% on understanding everything that comes before it in this book.
