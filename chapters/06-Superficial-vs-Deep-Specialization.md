# [CH06] Superficial vs. Deep Specialization

There are two valid ways to look at specialization. I will refer to one of them as *superficial*, and I don't mean that as an insult. I simply mean it doesn't go all that deep. It therefore has different requirements and delivers different benefits to your business.

For a long time, I felt like these two meanings of specialization were in tension. Maybe they are, but that need not stop me from helping you use either or both.

# Superficial Specialization

Superficial specialization is a marketing tactic, a market research technique, or some combination of the two. It might also be relatively temporary in duration, or done as a first transitional move out of the generalist market position.

Generally, superficial specialization means changing your marketing message; you stop focusing on technical inputs and start focusing on business outcomes or the needs of a specific market vertical or specific type of buyer. This change in your marketing message will trickle down into how you talk to clients as well.

You'll still have room to talk about technical inputs (your skill, your process, etc.), but those get pushed down to the level of a supporting detail in your message. At the headline level, your message becomes one that's focused on business problems and outcomes, contextualized within a particular vertical market, horizontal problem, or audience of buyers.

Superficial specialization might also mean specializing a digital marketing funnel so it speaks more specifically to a vertical or problem domain. You might have multiple "micro funnels" in place, each with a different flavor of specialization. I worked with a client who used this approach to experimentally identify where he could find the strongest interest in his DevOps consulting services. He tested two outbound email campaigns and got lukewarm interest from the market in the campaign focused on migrating away from Heroku but got \~80% open rates in the campaign focused on Kubernetes. This made it pretty clear where he could more easily gain visibility for his work. Building these two micro-funnels required work, but less work and investment than a "blind pivot" would require.

Superficial specialization is generally campaign-based, rather than a career development strategy. As a reminder from chapter 2, superficial specialization lines up with the notion that positioning is a verb; something you do actively over a short time frame in order to achieve some sort of tactical win (lead gen, dealing with a famine phase in your business, etc.)

# Deep Specialization

Deep specialization is a career development strategy. It looks as your market position as a noun; an asset that you build over time. It looks as your market position as the result of coordinated, disciplined action over a longer time frame to achieve a strategic win like becoming attractive to vastly better clients, becoming seen as a genuine expert, moving from implementation to advisory work, etc.

# Overlap Between These Two Concepts

There's some inevitable overlap between these two ways of understanding positioning. They both involve focusing or re-focusing, but the demands of deep specialization require that we commit 100% to a single chosen path for specialization.

That said, you might use multiple superficial specialization experiments to discover or validate a direction for deep specialization.

The deep specialization approach is more ambitious and takes longer to execute on. It's also the one that's more likely to result in a strong market position after all that work.

These two specialization approaches start at roughly the same place, but they end up at very different places because of one thing: *expertise*. Superficial specialization is a way to address some marketing inefficiencies; deep specialization is a way to transform your business model from one based on outputs to one based on expertise.

How should you choose between the two?

- If you have **low risk profile [^Until I elaborate on this idea more in chapter 10: Risk profile is a combination of your emotional comfort with risk and your ability to withstand a loss.] and low business maturity**: Consider superficial specialization.
- If **low risk profile and greater business maturity**: Validate via superficial, then go deep.
- If **high risk profile**: you've got lots of choices if you're smart about them. High risk profile doesn't mean you are guaranteed to succeed, but it does mean you are less likely to pull back or "flinch" at a critical moment when staying the course instead of flinching is the difference between success and failure.

# Chapter Summary

Superficial specialization is a marketing tactic; deep specialization is a career-development strategy. They are not mutually exclusive choices. You might use superficial specialization earlier in your career to get some quick marketing wins or experiment with several possible specializations and after you choose, you convert to the deep specialization approach in order to cultivate rare, valuable expertise.
