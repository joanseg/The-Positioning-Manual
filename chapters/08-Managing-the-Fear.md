# [CH09] Managing the Fear

Chapter 3 warned you about The Fear. But, now that you've peered more deeply into the world of specialization and what your options might be there, it's a good time to talk about practical ways to manage The Fear.

# The First Fear Management Approach Is To _Lower The Stakes_

Lowering the stakes might look like specializing a digital marketing funnel -- rather than your entire business -- as a low-stakes way to experiment with various possible specializations before committing more fully. 

Or alternately, build a market-first (rather than solution-first) productized service as a way to test demand for a specialized service. If it goes well, that service could eventually "take over" your business and enable a generalist to specialist transition with less existential fear. Both of these approaches fit under the superficial specialization umbrella discussed in Chapter 6. In the right situation, these can be useful approaches. 

My main caveat here is to properly align your expectations. Lowering the stakes might be the exact right decision because a low-stakes experiment is all your risk profile and personality can handle (see Chapter 10 for more on risk profile). But lowering the stakes might also reduce the potential upside for you! Or you might half-ass it because there's not much on the line, and therefore get half-assed results. 

Lowering the stakes is not a panacea, and it's not the only right approach.

# The Second Fear Management Approach Is To _Gather More Evidence_

Specializing can feel like making a decision that has significant potential consequences; specifically a significant potential for loss. When you make a decision like that without a lot of information, it's naturally a bit intimidating. You find yourself saying things like "Am I really just guessing here?" or "How can I be sure this will work out well for me?". 

The 100% honest answer is that you **can not** be 100% sure it will work out well for you, even if you do gather extensive evidence. I can't be sure I won't die driving my car to the grocery store later today, and according to the Insurance Information Institute, that terrible possibility is far *less likely* to happen than accidentally poisoning myself with a prescription or illegal drug! We can't be 100% sure of much in this life. 

But what you can do is gather evidence. You can look "look before you leap". You can identify patterns that inform your specialization decision.

Chapter 11 goes way deeper into this, but for now just know that the best antidote to uncertainty is the right kind of data interpreted in the right kind of way. I refer to this as evidence, and Chapter 11 suggest what kinds you'll need, and how to gather it.

# "I'm _Mad As Hell_, And I'm Not Going To Take This Anymore!"

I've seen some folks use the emotional energy of _anger_ to fuel a transition from generalist to specialist. I think this is part of what helped me make the leap at a critical point in my own career.

Thanks to our mammalian fight-or-flight wiring, anger can temporarily override our normal self-preservation characteristics. Now imagine that you're not feeling indiscriminate anger, but a more focused, "righteous anger" at how operating as a generalist has become harmful to your business. 

This kind of focused, righteous anger could be a very effective antidote to The Fear, and a very effective catalyst for bold decision-making as you decide what specialization opportunity to pursue. This isn't something you'd do on purpose, but if you happen to be feeling angry about how things are going as a generalist, that anger could fuel a (still carefully considered, I hope) move to a specialist market position.

# _Courage and Risk Tolerance_ Are The Best Antidote

The fear management approaches described above come with compromises. This one doesn't: **Do something courageous**! Take a calculated risk! If you can do this with the question of how you focus your business, you can do it with lots of other aspects of your business, and I can't think of any real downside to acquiring this new ability to take calculated risks. In fact, one of the best career-maximizing heuristics I can offer you is to always seek as much risk as you can comfortably handle.

I'm not recommending wild or indiscriminate risk-taking. I'm simply recommending you do your homework on how best to specialize (again, Chapter 11 has more on this), gather enough evidence to validate your decision, and then take assertive action on that decision. 

If you're not currently in the position to make a courageous specialization decision, of course that's OK. Your focus instead should be taking smaller risks and smaller forms of assertive action, perhaps focused on increasing rates or profitability within your current generalist market position. These kinds of smaller risks will give you practice with risk-taking as well as pave the way for making bigger and bolder changes in your business.

# Suggestions For Cultivating Courage

Specialization is not a face tattoo. I mean to be both serious and humorous here.

To contextualize how serious a decision specialization is, let me sketch out a spectrum showing levels of commitment to change in order from low to high:

- **The clothes you put on first thing in the morning**. How hard is it to change these?
- **Buying a television using Amazon.com**. This can be relatively low cost on the front end and has low switching cost if you decide to get a different one, upgrade, or get rid of it within the no-questions-asked return period. It's a very reversible, low-friction decision.
- **Buying a car**. This is more costly -- both in terms of up-front cost and switching cost -- than buying a TV, but still a decision that can be changed or un-made. It does have some friction because you need to go to a car dealer in the first place, and to change either go back to a dealer for a trade-in or sell it yourself, both of which entail real effort.
- **Buying a house**. Take the car example and basically 10x the level of work and potential switching cost.
- **Getting legally married**. You can get un-married, but not without some level of paperwork that -- even in Oregon where I got divorced -- is more extensive than what you signed to get married in the first place. And that's not counting the emotional and financial cost of a separation and all that might happen during and after the separation/divorce.
- **Getting a tattoo on your face**. Yes, these can be removed, but that's painful, and the affected skin is never the same as it was before the tattoo. It really is, in some sense, truly permanent. It's the only thing on this list that *is* physically permanent.

My first suggestion for cultivating courage is to realize where specialization actually fits in this spectrum from easy-to-change to impossible-to-change. Depending on several things (how complex your marketing infrastructure is, how big or complex your business is), I'd say specialization is somewhere between buying a TV and buying a house in terms of how difficult it is to change. If you're evaluating decisions in terms of permanence, you should put a _lot_ more thought into getting a face tattoo than any of the other decisions on this list. :)

I need to remind you of the difference between specialization and your market position. Specialization is the front-end decision; your market position is the reputation you build up by specializing and following through on it for years. 

A market position is much harder to change than a specialization decision. The specialization decision is, after all, just a decision. It's "in here" in your head. The reputation that you build as a result of the decision is "out there" in the minds of many people in the market. Not only do you not have direct access to those many minds in the market, changing what's in those many minds is an indirect process of building visibility and trust.

The takeaway here is that _you have freedom to experiment with your specialization_, especially earlier in the process. I hope knowing this helps you make a more courageous decision. It's easier to be courageous when you realize you're making a decision that can be changed or un-made.

# See How Specialization Works For Others

I do a lot of labor-of-love work in this area to help show how specialization actually works:

- [http://specializationexamples.com](http://specializationexamples.com)
- [http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com](http://consultingpipelinepodcast.com)
- [http://theselfmadeexpert.com](http://theselfmadeexpert.com)

You might also find someone in your network who actually has specialized and talk to them! They'll be flattered you asked! 

Ask them the following:

- Did it work?
- What made it work or not work?
- What challenges did specialization present?
- What benefits did it create?
- What advice do you have for others wanting to specialize?
- What might you do differently next time?

# Run The Numbers

Again, nothing is 100% guaranteed, but here's what I've seen regarding the financial upside of specialization.

I can think of multiple examples of generalists specializing and working less while generating the same amount of revenue, or working the same amount and generating more revenue. 

Connie -- a self-employed mother of two -- cut her workload in half and maintained the same revenue (100% increase in profitability). Val -- another self-employed mom I've worked with -- maintained her workload and tripled her revenue (300% increase in profitability).

Professional services firms that squeeze every drop of benefit out of specialization and all the downstream advantages thereof (ability to value price, ability to sell advice rather than or in addition to implementation) can break into the vaunted territory of $400,000 in yearly revenue per full time equivalent (FTE). I'm not saying this is common, and I'm certainly not promising this for you, but it is possible.

Run the numbers for yourself. What would a 100% to 300% increase in profitability look like for _your_ business? Get specific about what this would mean for you. Maybe it's one of these:

- Finally able to buy a house
- Extend your runway from 3 months to 12 months, lower your stress level
- Feel less pressure to bill 40 hours/week
- Ability to invest in your highest-ROI investment, which is yourself

What you're doing here is *building a vision* for what your future could look like. That's why it's important to be specific. When you daydream about something desirable, you're specific. This is simply "daydreaming on purpose", and it can help you move through fear and indecision.

# Estimate The Cost Of _Not_ Specializing

Avoiding change seems like a way to spare yourself the cost and risk of changing, but avoiding change also has a cost of its own. This is because the world keeps on changing, and if you're running a business with a skills or output-based model, you're more exposed to the downside of change than an expertise-based business model is.

You don't get to decide how long skill in Objective C can command super-premium rates. The predictable market forces, other service providers in the market, and Apple themselves determine that, and they do so without much regard at all for how their decisions and actions effect your hourly rate. Swift or Reactive Native come along and partially replace Objective C, and while from a technical perspective Objective C still be used to build great apps, things have changed in a way that devalues Objective C skill. The inevitable hype around Swift or Reactive Native does some of the work of devaluing Objective C skill. Commoditization -- wherein high rates for Objective C skill attract competent competition from lower cost of living areas -- does the rest.

Without barriers to entry, licensing or formal certification requirements, or a professional standards body, super-premium rates for skill along don't last very long in the world of technology. You can pretty safely bet on a 5 to 7 year lifespan for super-premium rates.

When you're young, 5 to 7 years feels like a really long time, and making $200 hour feels like being wealthy. When you're past about age 40, 5 to 7 years feels like much less time, and $200/hr feels like a deeply discounted rate to access to your maturity, judgement, and ability to avoid stupid decisions. You also start to see a big difference between making $200/hr and actually being wealthy.

Even if you don't specialize, you'll still need to change with the changing times in order to remain competitive as a software developer. And I bet if you really think through the cost of upgrading your skillset at least every 3 to 5 years, you'll see that it's a significant time, emotional, and opportunity cost, even if not an actual financial cost.

Compare this cost to whatever you perceive the cost of specializing to be. It might level the playing field, or even tilt it in favor of specializing.

To be clear, I _am_ trying to make a strong case for specializing here and support you the best way a book possibly could, but I'm not trying to twist your arm and force you to do it. 

It's a little bit like getting married or being in a long-term romantic relationship. If _you_ don't fundamentally want to do it, it won't work. Romantic partners and the market can both smell someone who is pretending to want them, and neither of them ultimately react well to that odor.

# Chapter Summary

The best antidote to The Fear is courage combined with realizing that specialization is not a face tattoo. Courage is such a generally useful asset in business. Why not start cultivating it now with a courageous specialization decision?

Short of mustering that courage, you can try to lower the stakes or make incremental moves towards full specialization, and you can build a vision for how it can benefit your business.
