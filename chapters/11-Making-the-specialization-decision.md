# [CH11] Making the Specialization Decision

In earlier versions of this book, I looked at specialization through the lens of this, which I called the Value-Specificity curve.

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/value-specificity-curve.png)

My admonition at that time was simple: just move from where you are towards the global maximum on that curve. Where _is_ the global maximum on that curve? 

"I don't know, because it's unique to you! Just do it!"

It was the right idea, but expressed in a general, hand-wavey way. I can do better now. It's still very much a unique-to-you decision, but there is a 7-step process almost anyone can follow to help make the decision about how to specialize, presented in this chapter.

# Everybody Starts From A Different Place

We all approach the specialization decision from a different starting point. Yes, most non-specialists are generalists, and that means we're all starting from the same general starting point. But when you look closer, everyone is approaching the specialization decision with a different combination of skill, risk tolerance, business experience, and personality attributes. These differences matter.

If everyone was starting from the same place, I could offer perhaps just one "specialization decision-making recipe" that everyone could follow. But if I did that, some people's head start would be overlooked, and others lack of a head start -- or different form of head start -- would present them with insurmountable challenges. So in reality, the decision is very individualized.

When I'm working with a client, I'm looking at several factors to define their starting point. These factors include:

- Your previous client experience
- Your skillset
- Your interests
- Your risk profile
- Your financial strength or lack thereof
- Other aspects of your personality, like curiosity and assertiveness
- Other aspects of your life situation, like your ability to work harder or longer hours for a time, or a limited ability to do this burst of extra short-term work.

Taken together, these 7 factors tend to define your starting point.

# Additionally, Some Want Different Things

Just like everybody has a different starting point, everyone wants to achieve something slightly different by specializing.

At the most fundamental level, you either want to use specialization in a superficial way (to get some quick marketing wins, for example) or a deep way (to make it possible to cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise). But when I actually ask my clients why *they* want to specialize, I get an interesting range of answers. Some specific examples:

- "Just make my marketing easier/better"
- "Just tell me how to build a pipeline of opportunity so I'm not living hand to mouth"
- "I want better clients"
- "I want to be a powerful expert"
- "I want to build wealth"
- "Someone moved my cheese and I want it back"

Your answer to the question, "what do you want to achieve by specializing your business?" defines your end point. With a starting and end point defined, we have what it takes to draw a line, and the line between your starting and end point defines what you'll need to do to successfully specialize your business. Add to this personal factors like risk tolerance, and you have all the information you need to decide how to specialize your business.

# A Process For Deciding

Here's a reliable, 7-step process for deciding how to specialize.

In previous chapters, I've recommended that you just absorb concepts but avoid taking action. In this chapter, do one of two things:

1. If you just want to understand this process, then simply read it through.
2. But if you're ready to decide how to specialize, then actually do the work described in each step of this process. Give it the time required (it'll take more than just an hour or two), but don't get bogged down and lose momentum.

This process is based on you conducting an inventory of previous experience, along with some clerical stuff. Use whatever tool you like for that inventory, but do consider using something tabular like a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is delightfully low-tech while giving you all the power you need to sort and filter the results of your work. This makes it easier to spot patterns.

## 1) Inventory

**Vertical Inventory**: Inventory everything you've ever done for clients, employers, and any substantial side-projects.

For each thing in your inventory, include:

1. Client name
2. Market vertical that client is in
3. The business outcome of what you did for that client

**Horizontal Inventory**: Add to your inventory all horizontal abilities you currently have that help you move the needle for clients. The following would be horizontal abilities:

- Increase conversion rate on e-commerce stores
- Reduce downtime for critical infrastructure
- Integrate ERP with other systems
- Reduce cognitive load of using software

**Entrepreneurial Theses Inventory**: Add to your inventory all entrepreneurial theses you're sitting on. 

The difference between this and the horizontal inventory is that you might have to put together a team, or rent skill you don't have, or build something that requires up-front investment, or just generally take on more risk -- perhaps by pursuing a specialization you just can't validate but you believe deeply in -- as part of building out your market position.

## 2) Extend

Add to your inventory all verticals that interest you, even if you haven't worked in them before.

Make sure you have an uninterrupted hour or two before you do this next step. Go to <https://www.naics.com/naics-drilldown-table/>. Slowly read every top level item in the list of market verticals there.

Pause after you read each item. Let your imagination wander a bit. Ask yourself the following questions:

* "Is there more to this market vertical than I might think at first?"
* "Are there possibly companies in this market vertical that are struggling to effectively use technology that I have experience with?"
* "Would companies in this market vertical possibly get excited about the potential of software that I could build for them?"
* "Does this market vertical have smart software developers like me throwing themselves at it, or is it likely to be under-supplied with tech talent?"

As you do this, you are looking inside yourself to see if there is movement towards or away from each market vertical on the NAICS list. When you consider a market vertical like, let's say pharmeceuticals, does your imagination light up at least a little bit? Or does it contract at the thought of dealing with companies in that vertical? It does not matter _why_, you are simply looking for a subtle yes or no from your self.

If a market vertical gives you that subtle yes, then click into that top-level vertical on the NAICS site to explore the subcategories. Do the same kind of inquiry for each subcategory.

Add any NAICS categories that interest you -- ones that you get a subtle _yes_ to -- to your inventory. It does not matter if you have never worked in the vertical before. Just add it to your list.

Also add all horizontal abilities that interest you, even if you have only a poorly developed version of these abilities. The NAICS list won't help you with the ideation here, so try to think about problems or ways of improving a business that are a) interesting to you personally and b) likely to effect businesses across multiple verticals.

## 3) Quantify

Score each item on your inventory according to:

- **Access**: how deep does your business or personal network extend into this market vertical?
- **Credibility**: how credible will prospects find you? Have you produced results for them before? Can you "read their mind" during a sales conversation?
- **Impact**: For rows on your inventory that describe actual client work (rather than verticals or horizontals or entrepreneurial theses that you are interested in) score the impact your work had for your client. Did it make them money, save them money, increase efficiency, or help them achieve a strategic advantage of any kind? If so, that's impact. Your scores should be relative to other work your business has done, not work other businesses have done.
- **Profitability**: For rows on your inventory that describe actual client work, score how profitable the work was for your business.
- **Interest**: What is your personal level of interest in this area? If you're a small firm, your ability to delegate away uninteresting stuff may be limited, so set a low score for stuff you're un-interested in.

As you do this scoring, use a scale of 1 to 3 (whole numbers only) to keep things simple and avoid analysis paralysis.

## 4) Rank And Eliminate

At this point, you almost surely have a big, messy inventory. Let's turn it into a reasonable shortlist.

You're using a spreadsheet for this inventory, right? I hope so, because I'd recommend at this point you add two columns containing formulas:

- Aggregate score = Impact score + Profit score + Interest score
- Risk score = 7 - Access score - Credibility score

Now each opportunity described in your inventory has a rough quantitative score describing the potential attractiveness of that opportunity and the risk of that opportunity. Is this scoring perfect? No. Can you totally delegate your decision making to this score? No.

What you do have is a simple, useful way to prioritize opportunity and weigh risk. This is profoundly useful.

Sort your inventory in a way that puts opportunities with the highest Aggregate score at the top of the list.

Flag opportunities that are too risky. You've got your risk profile score from the self-assessment in Chapter 11, so flag any items on your inventory that have a Risk score that's higher than your risk profile score. The measurement scale of the self-assessment is designed to match the measurement scale of the inventory Risk score.

Also flag opportunities that have one of the following deal-breaker flaws:

- **Low importance**: Buyers see the service offering as un-important. Trying to change their perception is somewhere between difficult and impossible, so treat this as a deal-breaker flaw.
- **Excessively long buying cycle**: If you have the runway to handle a long buying cycle, great! But if you don't, it's a deal-breaker flaw.
- **Accessibility**: A market with 10,000 prospects that you can't reach is the same thing to your business as a market with 0 prospects.Do you have a repeatable way to access buyers or decision-makers or recommenders? If not, then you'll need to create one to successfully move past this potential deal-breaker.
- **External forces**: Are any external threats to your market apparent? Keep in mind that external forces (changes in legislation, disruptive competitors, economic impacts focused on a single sector) are not always a threat to *you* even if they are a threat to your clients. Your value as a specialist may come from helping your clients use software to deal with external threats.
- **Marketing approach**: Do you understand what marketing approach will work well for the prospects you want to reach? You _can not_ dictate to your prospects which marketing approach is ideal for reaching them. _They_ get to decide that, and you can only decide to submit the right "marketing API calls" or focus elsewhere where your preferred "marketing API calls" are compatible with the prospects you want to reach.

You now have an inventory that's sorted by the attractiveness of the opportunities, and you've flagged specialization opportunities that are potentially too risky or suffer deal-breaker flaws.

## 5) Enrich

I have you do the rank and eliminate step prior to this one in order to reduce the amount of market research you need to do here.

I want you to figure out a rough market size or marketing approach.

If any of your top 3 specialization opportunities are vertical in nature, you need to understand how large that market is. Imagine that one of your top 3 opportunities is "credit unions". You need to figure out about how many credit unions there are that also are large enough to afford to hire you and small enough to take you seriously. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to subscribe to LinkedIn's Sales Navigator product. If you're cash-strapped, you'll view the ~$80/mo price as expensive, but there is a 1-month free trial that may help.

Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to search for companies (Accounts, in LinkedIn parlance) in the vertical of interest. Filter out companies that are too small to afford your services and too large to take you seriously. The Sales Navigator search has filters for Industry and Company Head Count search criteria, so you should be able to get a pretty good market size very quickly unless there's no Industry that matches your vertical of interest.

A market that is smaller than 1,000 prospective clients[^Remember that you're not looking for the raw size of the market, but the size adjusted by excluding companies that are too small to afford you and too large to take you seriously.] is likely too small, and a market that is larger than 10,000 prospects is likely too large.

If any of your top 3 specialization opportunities are horizontal in nature, you need to have a viable method for connecting with those opportunities. Imagine that one of your top 3 opportunities is "integrating ERP systems with warehouse management systems". Can you use outbound marketing or personal relationships to reach these opportunities? If you can't, think long and hard about the inbound marketing work you'll need to do, the skill and effort it will take to do it, and the time it will take for it to work. If you can't see a viable path to connecting with these opportunities using marketing, then go ahead and flag the opportunity as un-viable.

## 6) Validate

The next step is to validate that the right-sized opportunities you have left on your list have some "signs of life". We do this by _documenting relevant market interest_.

You have several options for doing this:

- Build a list of competitors and make sure you can find at least a few and that there aren't more than 20. Google or industry-specific directories are your best bet here. You are looking for specialized competitors, not generalists that happen to claim they are faux-specialized in the same area you're investigating.
- Find conference talks that roughly map to how you might specialize.
- Find any other evidence that money is being spent in a way that maps to the way in which you might specialize.
- Reach out to and speak with any competitors or non-competitive experts that you can.

If you're pursuing an entrepreneurial thesis, then the above forms of market viability may not be present, so your best bet will be to Reach out to and speak with potential clients/customers using a customer development or Jobs to be Done style of interview-based market research.

Additionally, you might create a Blue Ocean Strategy-style strategy canvas to make sure your entrepreneurial theory targets a real opportunity in the market and validate that how you're differentiating makes good sense.

## 7) Decide

You have enough information to decide now. You don't have enough information to guarantee that the decision will work out well (you can never get to this level of certainty because there are factors that are impossible to predict or measure), but you do have enough information to make an intelligent decision. 

So decide, dammit! :)

# Chapter Summary

The process presented here has several checkpoints in order to reduce the risk of specializing in a way that's wrong for you. That makes for a somewhat laborious process, but in general this is the right tradeoff.

At the same time, small company size can be an advantage that increases agility. This can allow you successfully embrace riskier ways of specializing than larger companies might be able to.

You will find the right specialization approach for _you_ somewhere between these two poles of low and high risk.

As you do, please remember that you are not getting a face tattoo, and you can iterate on your first decision. The opportunity cost of inaction is too high to let analysis paralysis stop you from moving forward.
