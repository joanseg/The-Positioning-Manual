# [CH03] Who This Manual is For

This manual will be most helpful to a narrow range of people:

- Owners of technical services firms like dev shops, technical consultancies, web or digital agencies, and SaaS companies.
- Independent consultants or freelancers of many stripes, though all my examples in this manual are specific to the technical rather than the creative end of the professional services spectrum.
- People who are considering making the leap to solo self-employment but haven't done it yet.
- Self-employed people who need to be making more money within 24 to 36 months, but can invest 6 to 12 months of effort to lay the foundation.

This manual will *not* be immediately helpful to you if you have very limited work experience or "the wolf is at the door" in terms of your finances. Developing a desirable market position requires discipline that will be very difficult to muster if you have little savings, credit, or leeway in terms of saying no to work in the short term. 

Making a good specialization decision requires a certain amount of self-awareness about your strengths and preferences, and you just can't discover that stuff without a year or three of client work under your belt.
