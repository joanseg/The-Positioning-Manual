# Making the Specialization Decision

In earlier versions of this book, I looked at specialization through the lens of this, which I called the Value-Specificity curve: TODO link to image

My admonition at that time was simple: just move from where you are towards the global maximum on that curve. Where _is_ the global maximum on that curve? "I don't know, because it's unique to you! Just do it!"

It was the right idea, but expressed in a general, hand-wavey way. I can do better now. It's still very much a unique-to-you decision, but there is a 7-step process almost anyone can follow to help make the decision about how to specialize, presented in this chapter.

## Everybody starts from a different place

We all approach the specialization decision from a different starting point. Yes, most non-specialists are generalists, and that means we're all starting from the same abstracted starting point. But when you look closer, everyone is approaching the specialization decision with a different combination of skill, risk tolerance, business experience, and personality attributes. These differences matter.

If everyone was starting from the same place, I could offer perhaps just one "specialization decision-making recipe" that everyone could follow. But if I did that, some people's head start would be overlooked, and others lack of a head start -- or different form of head start -- would present them with insurmountable challenges. So in reality, the decision is very individualized.

When I'm working with a coaching client, I'm looking at several factors to define their starting point. These factors include:

- Your previous client experience
- Your skillset
- Your interests
- Your risk tolerance
- Your financial strength or lack thereof
- Other aspects of your personality, like curiosity and assertiveness
- Other aspects of your life situation, like your ability to work harder or longer hours for a time, or a limited ability to do this burst of extra short-term work.

Taken together, these 7 factors tend to define your starting point.

## Some want different things

Just like everybody has a different starting point, everyone wants to achieve something slightly different by specializing.

At the most fundamental level, you either want to use specialization in a superficial way (to get some quick marketing wins, for example) or a deep way (to make it possible to cultivate exceptionally valuable expertise). But when I actually ask my clients why *they* want to specialize, I get an interesting range of answers. Some specific examples:

- "Just make my marketing easier/better"
- "Just tell me how to build a pipeline of opportunity so I'm not living hand to mouth"
- "I want better clients"
- "I want to be a powerful expert"
- "I want to build wealth"
- "Someone moved my cheese and I want it back"

Your answer to the question, "what do you want to achieve by specializing your business?" defines your end point. With a starting and end point defined, we now have what it takes to draw a line, and the line between your starting and end point defines what you'll need to do to successfully specialize your business. Add to this personal factors like risk tolerance, and you have all the information you need to decide how to specialize your business.

## A Process For Deciding

{TODO: fill this out}

### 1) Inventory

All previous significant experience (through a lens of what vertical that experience is in)

All horizontal abilities to move the needle, both actual and theoretical

All entrepreneurial theses you're sitting on (difference between this and the above is that you might have to put together a team, or rent skill you don't have, or build something that requires up-front investment, or just generally take on more risk--perhaps by pursuing a specialization you just can't validate but you believe deeply in--as part of building out your market position)

### 2) Extend

All verticals that interest you

Horizontals that interest you

### 3) Quantify

Score all the items on the inventory according to:

- Access
- Credibility
- Impact
- Profitability
- Interest

Consider using a 3-point scale

### 4) Rank and Eliminate

Sort inventory based on aggregate score

Eliminate excessively risky items

{TODO: consider including other elimination factors from SWF, like buying cycle length, etc.}

### 5) Enrich

Size the market for top 3 vertical choices, make sure between 2k and 10k prospects

Identify options for reaching horizontal possibilities through networking or outbound. If none, think long and hard about the inbound marketing work you'll need to do, the skill and effort it will take to do it, and the time it will take to do it. I could see a little side-survey here where I present a curated list of lead gen options (based perhaps on trust velocity or something similar) and ask readers to think through what it would take for them to execute on 1 to 3 of them consistently.

### 6) Validate

You're looking to document relevant market interest, that's all

Options for doing this:

- Build a list of competitors, make sure you can find at least a few and that there aren't too many (\>20)
- Find conf talks that roughly map to your particular advantage
- Find any other evidence that money is being spent in a way that maps to your particular advantage
- Reach out to and speak with any competitors or non-competitive experts that you can {Note: this is such a great shortcut!}

If you're pursuing an entrepreneurial thesis, then the above forms of market viability may not be present, so your best bet will be to:

- Reach out to and speak with potential clients/customers using a customer development or JTBD style of interview-based market research
- Additionally, you might create a Blue Ocean Strategy-style strategy canvas to make sure your entrepreneurial theory targets a "real" opportunity in the market and validate that how you're differentiating makes good sense

### 7) Decide

You have enough information to decide now. You don't have enough information to guarantee that the decision will work out well (you can never get to this level of certainty because there are factors that are impossible to predict or measure), but you do have enough information to make an intelligent decision. So decide, dammit!
