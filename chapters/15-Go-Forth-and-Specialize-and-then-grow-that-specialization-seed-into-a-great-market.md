# Go Forth and Specialize! (And then grow that specialization seed into a great market position!)

I hope I've supplied you with all the information, processes, best practices, and examples you need to make a great specialization decision for your business. The goal of this manual has always been to be a comprehensive resource for making the specialization decision.

Because decisions are invisible without action, I've also had to take you into the beginning stakes of taking action on the specialization decision and that's why we've covered the topics of marketing and expertise.

I hope you find--as so many of my clients have--that making that decision unleashes a burst of excitement, newfound momentum, new interest from clients, and new business opportunity, all in short order.

It may not, though. If it doesn't, don't give up. Learn why it didn't work. Iterate based on what you learn. Be patient, resilient, and flexible. 

How many things in your life have you done with perfect results the first time you tried them? If your life is at all like mine, I'd wager almost none. Even with expert assistance like this book, there's a learning process, so don't shy away from that  learning curve.

## Gratitude

I owe a debt of gratitude to many people for helping with this book.

My wife Cheryl, whose love, patience, and encouragement has been vital.

The trees, creeks, and landscape around Carson National Forest in Taos, NM, who lent me sanity and calm during a personally difficult time.

My parents, who filled our home with books and music, helped me learn to question, drove me countless times to the public library, and created enough stability at home that I didn't leave there a broken person. These are priceless gifts and privileges that live on in me today.

Jonathan Stark, for challenging me to specialize years ago.

Blair Enns, whose _Win Without Pitching Manifesto_ was an impactful experience that supplied me with the concepts I needed to begin exploring the domain of specialization.

David C. Baker, who has long offered warm support for my work and who included me in a wonderful writing retreat in late 2019 that helped push the third edition of this book over the finish line.

And finally, I thank the 2,081 customers of the first and second edition of this manual, especially all those who wrote with thoughtful and challenging questions that helped me pierce the epidermis of expertise on this topic so I could bring you this much improved version of the manual. I couldn't have done it without y'all. Thank you.
