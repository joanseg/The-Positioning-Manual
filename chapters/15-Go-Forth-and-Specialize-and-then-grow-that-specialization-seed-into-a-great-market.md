# Go Forth and Specialize! (And then grow that specialization seed into a great market position!)

- I hope I've supplied you with all the information, processes, best practices, and examples you need to make a great specialization decision for your business.
- And I hope you find--as so many of my clients have--that making that decision unleashes a burst of excitement, newfound momentum, new interest from clients, and new business opportunity, all in short order.
- It may not, though. If it doesn't, don't give up. Learn why it didn't work. Iterate based on what you learn. Be patient, resilient, and flexible. How many things in your life have you done with perfect results the first time you tried them? I'd wager almost none. Even with expert assistance like this book, there's a learning process, so don't shy away from the specialization learning curve either.
